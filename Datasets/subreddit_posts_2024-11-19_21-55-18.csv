1732064559.0,"Driver misinterpreted mothers instructions and canceled order, will she get charged?","This is for a recent order from about an hour ago that my elderly mother ordered. She just got out of the hospital and ordered a meal. In her instructions, she mentioned bringing it up the stairs because she just got out of the hospital and can't go down the stairs. Because she was in recovery still she fell asleep and missed the driver's call back. But apparently, the driver zeroed in on the word hospital and disregarded every other word in the instructions and left a message saying there's no hospital just a house in the woods. The driver canceled the order after mother didn't respond back immediately. 

I checked the app but doesn't look like she was charged yet, but from reading uber usually charges if the the driver picked up the order and made an attempt to call. Should we expect a charge to appear and get ready to dispute it with uber or the bank?",UberEATS,5,2,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gvdbxw/driver_misinterpreted_mothers_instructions_and/

Just a heads up to anyone delivering in Newport Beach, CA specifically on Von Karman Avenue - there are business parks with no loading zone areas outside the mandatory paid entry.

Shortly after I started taking deliveries, the app offered me the Mastercard for instant payments so I got that.  It also offered me the card/account for shopping orders -I haven't pursued that yet but I might at some point.    
  
Then it offered me the alcohol delivery option. Even though I'm a near-100% teetotaler myself, I jumped right on it for a couple reasons: 1. From the various kinds of businesses I've worked as a server, I know that alcohol adds a whole other level of tip lucrativeness, and 2. I would rather safely bring alcohol to wherever people want to drink it than to have them drive home drunk from bars, or to stores to buy more after they've already been drinking.  

But my application has sat like this for at least a week, maybe 2.  Is this unusual?  How much longer would you wait before trying to contact Uber to see if something went wrong?

1731972811.0,Such a scam in the way,"I live in Seattle. I normally use Uber eats to place order for pickup since a lot of restaurants really use uber eats for their takeout orders.

The problem is the Seattle tax which a $13 order will end up $28 in delivery which is crazy.

However! Today! A quick finger of mine didn‚Äôt place an order from ‚Äúpick up‚Äù instead of delivery.  I realized the mistake and cancelled the order right away.  Chipotle stated they don‚Äôt deal with order itself if it‚Äôs been ordered through Uber eats.  Yet Uber eats shows chipotle picked up the order and already worked on the food within 2 minutes of offer ‚Äúwhich seems super unlikely but okay?‚Äù‚Ä¶. And due to the order had been processed, a cancellation will subject to be the same as food had been made. So cancellation without delivery would still cost me full price of meal.

So the million dollar question is. If that‚Äôs the case for cancellation and since I already PAID for the food. Can I go pick up my food that I paid? NOPE! What uber eats meant is ‚Äúno matter food had been made or not! The order had been gone through Uber eats it means the transaction has been made and cancellation doesn‚Äôt matter! They charged me full price of food anyway‚Äù.

That leaves which a sour taste for me. If it‚Äôs not that I get my Uber eats credits from my American Express. I am most likely will NEVER order through Uber eats. Not only the charge of food delivery is 200% from picking up myself.  The cancellation that food hasn‚Äôt even been made will charge full price is ridiculous.

Last night my uber delivery person delivered the wrong order - I wanted Chinese, but instead I got Megan's suspiciously tempura-heavy Japanese order.

Finally got my food but I sadly didn't find it tasty after the sight and smell of all that tempura.

This morning, uber got back to me saying they won't do anything about the mix-up, and stating that my order is not eligible for a refund or adjustment. I called their support (the highly unpublicized number of 1-800-253-9377), but communicating with their support department is like chatting with a room full of dissociated people that are living on a planet where getting fucked-over is normal.

1731949387.0,Overnight Ubereats and DoorDash issues.,"I‚Äôve done Ubereats for months. I‚Äôve only done Thursday to Sunday or Friday to Sunday.
Time 10pm - 6am.
I do this because of low traffic and fast food lobbies are closed so you only have to go thru drive thru.

Issues I‚Äôve noticed is the wait time for orders. 
Even if I‚Äôm the first or only person in line or stuck in drive thru speaker order waiting to hear a person speak it always takes 5-20mins to receive the order. If I‚Äôm lucky some places have it done. I‚Äôve seen many workers during this time take their time or on their phones while I wait for order. 
I still update app and customer but I can‚Äôt cancel order if this is like this everywhere. 

Especially at night when fewer delivery drivers are out so you can get orders semi close or further. 
I get it‚Äôs my choice for choosing to work late. But I think both companies could be more understanding on the wait time and miles. The more time it takes the less money you make. The less drivers there are the more money for active drivers should make. 
Just my opinion on working overnight.

As for app. GPS doesn‚Äôt always take you to entrance.
Wait time is also long since you have to use gate code, guard entrance, finding building and what floor or what side of buildings. That all is taking up time. If I could have only houses pop up on my orders it be great. But the ones with community guards you still have to wait 5 mins to enter. 
DoorDash entering the last 3 digits that‚Äôs already on the order to complete the order is annoying. Ubereats doesn‚Äôt do that. Plus I wanna get the order complete and leave not sit there and type in 3 digits than clock complete or take a pic of receipt either. Especially while driving. Time is already sensitive for drivers to get the delivery done to receive the next order. 
Also DoorDash doesn‚Äôt let you communicate with customer unless they chat to you first. I was stuck at a gate with no gate code or don‚Äôt have enough info to deliver so customer doesn‚Äôt chat first unless your close enough to their location. Again time sensitive not enough money for time. 

Ubereats tips should have some mandatory tips. Most my orders are leave at door yet doesn‚Äôt matter how fast or well I deliver I‚Äôve had some no tippers. I just find it rude. Especially Walmart and 7/11 orders get no tippers. 

I live in Vegas it‚Äôs pretty busy. DoorDash orders come in very slowly. Actually when I do both apps and I choose to do an order on Ubereats than DoorDash wants to give me an order at the same time.
It‚Äôs fine sometimes but it‚Äôs like I get no orders unless I have an order already on Uber app which is weird. Happens all the time. I‚Äôve even waited 30mins for DD and nothing. But if I just do Uber in 5-10 or 30 mins and take it boom DoorDash gives me an order. 
Ubereats is has more orders and I‚Äôm glad I can deny orders that are 12miles for $5 but tips are never guaranteed. And when you do see and order that‚Äôs $11 for 5miles it‚Äôs not $11. That‚Äôs Ubereats estimate with maybe tips. Very misleading.

DoorDash is strict. Can‚Äôt cancel too much or it will count against you. Everywhere in my city is construction and 35mph to get to customer. I don‚Äôt think DoorDash knows how long it actually takes to get there cuz I keep getting late violations from 10mins - 30mins. 

Oh I don‚Äôt know why some restaurant that are closed get orders. App is not friendly when letting them know. If you don‚Äôt speak to customer service they will count it against you if you cancel for good reason. 

On daylight savings time Taco Bell closed at 2am but there usually 24hr there system was down too and I had double orders. I select closed on Ubereats and they count it against me even tho I don‚Äôt lie. I don‚Äôt get paid for it either. Also at the time I didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs best for customer to cancel order cuz if I cancel it does to another driver. But no comp for time and pay for a closed restaurant.
Had a $40 order for Wendy‚Äôs that‚Äôs closed. Even says on window they close at that time. I chat with Ubereats customer  service. No comp for time or miles. Lost $40 and got nothing.

I don‚Äôt understand how delivery apps are so low on pay. It‚Äôs till a job with no real benefits and it‚Äôs contract. It really does take advantage of drivers. You can get more money from a part time job.

Sorry I‚Äôm ranting but being new to all of this even reading Reddits of people doing this for awhile will say it‚Äôs not worth it much.

Also people tell others to get real jobs but you don‚Äôt know where in life they are and maybe they had no choice but to do delivery apps or their trying there best to find a job and not having luck. I‚Äôve heard many customers, staff at restaurants and some drivers say job market has been more difficult. Barely getting interviews no matter how many times you call and show interest. So don‚Äôt judge others if they only have this for income. ",UberEATS,2,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gu9kpd/overnight_ubereats_and_doordash_issues/

Respectfully I just want to say to the drivers. Please I get it , if you need the money fair enough, but I paid a high as hell tip and priority to avoid this, and you don't HAVE to accept my order. 

So just a word of warning. I will be lowering my tip once I get my food if the temperatures aren't literally perfect ( or in this case with ice cream, not melted at all.) And that's reasonable as I paid exorbitantly for them to NOT drive around with my food once they already picked it up. 

Tldr: don't multi app on a very high tipper and then expect them to not lower their tip. Just because I tip generously doesn't mean I don't get pretty annoyed at people spitting in the face of my generosity. 

Edit: I'm a zoomer, we've failed the word literally, my point was simply ice cream soup isn't all that's neccesary for me to be upset. It being 15% melted also wouldn't be cool considering its 7 mins away and I paid for priority to ensure no stacked orders, and tipped high as hell to prevent a financial need to multiapp to survive.

1731862616.0,UK McDonald‚Äôs and deliveries - something has to be done,"I feel as though things have reached a point with McDonald‚Äôs and deliveries in the UK where it simply can‚Äôt continue.

Missing items, incorrect items, poor quality of items, missing sauces. The list goes on. 

I understand mistakes happen, but as a consumer they make it near on impossible to get compensation for these issues. I had an entire meal missing from an order a few weeks ago and the best Uber could do was offer a refund of ¬£1.80! McDonald‚Äôs aren‚Äôt interested either when I contacted them.

The real kicker is when you order directly through the official McDonald‚Äôs app rather than Uber. There is absolutely no way to report missing items or make a complaint about anything at all. You are instructed to either call your delivery driver (a joke, because they only delivered what they were given) or use the ‚Äòonline assistant‚Äô chat bot which ultimately just tells you to call the driver as well!

I did manage to get given an 0800 number which was a dedicated McDonald‚Äôs Uber Eats helpline and the lady there promised me she would refund my order within 15 working days. 20 working days came and went. No refund. I ended up doing a chargeback through my bank.

1731812304.0,Do not use UberEATS.,"Let me explain. The service is different than it was a year ago.

If you have any issues with your order, your only option for support is text chat with a machine. This often does not understand the issue.

If you resolve it this way and get a refund, you will not get a refund for the full amount you paid. Either the delivery fee, service fee, or tip is retained by Uber.

If you order food and it says ""max delivery time 90min"" you can select priority and it changes to something like ""max delivery time 75min."" However, after you pay, the max delivery time can change to greater than 120min. Meaning if you have a schedule to keep, Uber has fraudulently represented the delivery window. Now you have to spend 30 minutes on text chat and 30 more minutes before you can leave. Costing me an hour is worth more than I paid for the food.

If you get connected to an agent (I encourage everyone to try this), they will simply pretend to not understand you while prividing prepared responses. __They will then simply disconnect the chat__.

This is unreal. Grubhub and doordash are simple, east, and accurate. They provide full refunds, do not hang up on you, and their order delivery estimates do not change after receiving payment.

1731802038.0,Cancellation fun,"Is it physically possible to cancel an order within five minutes using the ubereats desktop website if you don't know how to do it beforehand?  This is an honest question.

I just tried to cancel an order 30 seconds or so after having made it.  After using puzzle solving skills and advanced AI to work out how to cancel the order, I finally get to an online chatbot who points out that it took me more than five minutes to cancel my order.  After several attempts I finally manage to talk to a human being.  I point out that I wanted to cancel it after 30 seconds but ubereat's systems took more than 5 minutes to decipher and use and point out that they are intentionally hard to use to the extent that it's unrealistic to expect a regular person who hasn't done it before to be able to cancel an order within five minutes.  I accept the situation and simply ask for instructions on how to cancel an order in the future within five minutes.  The helpdesk guy gives me instructions for the mobile app I believe?  I point out that his instruction don't make sense and that I'm using a desktop computer and ask for instructions on how to cancel an order in the future.  Instead of doing this he transfers me to another team.  In most companies this would mean you're going to speak to someone else immediately.  At ubereats they tell me that this means that they're going to try to respond to me somehow in 6 to 12 hours.

""Message received! We will do our best to respond within 6 to 12 hours.""

I call uber on the phone and it's impossible to get through.  There is no ubereats phone line.  There is only one for uber drivers which physically won't let you get through if you're not registered as a delivery person.

I'm familiar with terrible customer service but this is next level.  If you're going to make your policy that customers need to cancel within five minutes then there should be a visible and easy to use cancel button.",UberEATS,5,0,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gt0srt/cancellation_fun/

This silence speaks volumes and seems like clear evidence of consumer fraud.

To make it worse, I confirmed with the merchant that they never received any payment from Uber. So where‚Äôs my money going? Uber is essentially keeping my money for a service that was never provided, and they‚Äôre refusing to justify their actions.

This is not just bad customer service‚Äîthis feels like a deliberate scam. Under U.S. consumer protection laws, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, this behavior is illegal. I‚Äôm planning to file formal complaints with the FTC and my state‚Äôs attorney general to address this.

1731788852.0,Dear customers,"Hello.

Dear Ubef Eats customers.


I would like to just inform you dear customers about to search a bit more about how Uber Eats screw up drivers by giving them mostly trips like for example $3 for 20 km or $6 to do 13km and similar to this one. So my question is for you customer, will you drive that distance with your car for that money?


Many great drivers are giving up either with the time where they find out about they actually lose money cuz are doing that few cent deliveries and then after few months they are not afford to maintenance their vehicles or faster, depend of when they will find it out about they actually are not earning enough money. Many of them have no choice because they must work cuz have family, kids, bills to pay, etc. And here I believe you understand their and this situation.

Very often customers also leave negative feedbacks simply with no reason or lie to Uber Eats about the food was stolen, damaged, spilled, not delivered etc, or they decrease the tip amount to screw up the driver, with no reason, why? Mostly to get extra food or money back, and guess who suffer the most? Of course drivers. For example driver accepted the order for $9 to do 13km. So it is $3 from Uber Eats plus $6 tip from the customer. Very often customers decrease thet amount to $0, witn no reason, why? But the problem is Uber Eats is not protecting at all the drivers with this issues.

I bet other delivery companies are not better about it and probably screw up drivers in the same way, cuz why not? Nothing illegal, yes?

So how much money will you have in your pocket after this delivery for $3 or $6 minus gasoline, minus your car usage, not mention about the time which is usually between 30 to 45 min as total delivery time.

Best real and negative complaints against Uber Eats company you can find on many Facebook groups where posts with the screenshot (many of them are from USA but many also from Canada) are publication and then you will know why your order is not delivered fast enough because your order is jumping between driver cellphones and if it's similar to the ones examples mentioned above then that may be the reason. 

I would like to send here big warm hugs for the customers who give drivers reasonable tips because then YOU keep them in this business, not Uber Eats, and God may bless you for that.

All above examples I found out in Facebook Uber Eats posts and from my experience as Uber Eats full time driver. And if you want you can also read a lot about that issues to understand how actually Uber Eats company works with customers. This will help you to answer on your questions maybe about why why my food is so late delivered or maybe other issues.

1731685584.0,Flat rate nightmares (also AVOID walmart orders) ,"Last night I signed up for the flat rate ""opportunity"" of $18.50/hour. Usually, I love these. 

I accepted a delivery from walmart for their black friday deals. I get to walmart, have 2 other deliveries offered from same place, so I accept. 

The wait time to get the packages from walmart is nearly 2 hours. They are slammed and delivery drivers are definitely NOT on their priority list. I've had a few orders get cancelled, and I haven't delivered much yet (started 2 weeks ago) so my cancellation rate is a bit high. I don't want to cancel 3 more deliveries, so I wait. ..and wait. 

FINALLY get the packages, start delivering. Get finished FOUR HOURS after I accept. 

I look at the compensation at it seems.. off. I do the math. (50.23 / 18.50 = 2.7!??) 

So I fire up live chat and am told I was paid corrected ""based on their maximum compensation policies"" 

I send the screen shot for the flat rate opportunity which states online ""flat rate of 18.50/hour for active time, from acceptance to completion"". I point this out and am told that I'm wrong, and he hopes I understand. Anyone seen a maximum compensa

  
... I understand that's wage theft. (and that I live in a state that takes it pretty seriously.. I worked in payroll prior to becoming a stay at home Mom looking for extra Christmas money). 

So I call, and the nice lady that I speak to confirms that I've been paid incorrectly and I'm now on hold to be correctly paid. She then tries to transfer me to the department that can fix it. I'm currently being bounced around on hold. I get transferred again, and again, and again. Still dealing with it. 

It would be SUPER nice if they could get consistent.

I re-added my order to the cart and it showed the lower tax amount (exactly $0.16 less than the tax I was charged)

Asked chat support, guy was rude and said my request for a refund is denied and then ended the chat on me (I was not asking for a refund I wanted him to explain the reason).

Then she said the fees can change depending on the size of the order.. I‚Äôm like what the drivers are weighing the orders before delivering? She doesn‚Äôt have more info‚Ä¶

So yeah, all I got was a reference number because apparently all they can do it log the issue and in her words ‚Äúit‚Äôll get handled‚Äù. I asked for an email address, they don‚Äôt do emails. I asked for a phone number, they don‚Äôt have any other numbers

I'm reaching out here as the last resort because the Uber Eats support team has been unhelpful to help resolve this issue: Last week, I placed a grocery order through Uber Eats valued at **32‚Ç¨.** However, I was charged over **50‚Ç¨** on my bank statement, which seems to be due to a system error. Unfortunately, I didn't notice this overcharge at the time. Two days later, I was charged again, but this time the correct amount of **32‚Ç¨**.



After noticing the second charge, I contacted Uber Eats support. They told me everything seemed ok from their side and suggested me to speak with my bank, and my bank advised me to cancel my card. Digging deeper, I realized that the **50‚Ç¨** charge doesn't match any order details in the app, but the timestamp aligns perfectly with my order time. Same hour and same exact minute.



I've reached out to Uber support multiple times, but they seem confused and haven't been able to resolve the issue. They say they cannot understand my problem, they say that the system tells the charges are legit and after two days of trying to get this situation figured out they locked the ticket and stopped responding. If the **50‚Ç¨** charge happened at the exact same time I made my order it's obvious that it was Uber Eats.

1731610165.0,I Canceled My Uber Eats Membership After Two Horrifying Experiences,"I‚Äôve officially canceled my Uber Eats membership, and I won‚Äôt be ordering from them again.

I used to love using Uber Eats and found the monthly membership worthwhile. Most of the time, my orders went smoothly, and when there were issues, getting a refund was easy.

However, about a month and a half ago, I had a horrific experience. I ordered a breakfast quesadilla, and as I bit into it, I realized the bacon was undercooked and tasted off. I switched to my side of sweet potatoes, only to find what seemed to be a dead maggot in them! I was absolutely mortified and sick to my stomach. After getting off the phone with customer service, I ended up vomiting quite a bit.

After receiving my order, I immediately contacted Uber Eats to report the issue and request a refund. They told me my complaint would be sent to a specialized team for review, so I expected a full refund, especially since I couldn‚Äôt eat the food and ended up feeling ill. I sent them pictures of the undercooked bacon and the maggot-infested potatoes, which I‚Äôll probably post below. However, after two weeks without a response, I contacted them again, and they said they would notify the specialized team. When they finally got in touch with me, they told me that I didn‚Äôt qualify for a refund!

When I pressed for an explanation, repeatedly asking, ‚ÄúWhat is the reason?!‚Äù they claimed I waited too long to complain. I reminded them that I had reached out within about half an hour of receiving my order, and their slow response was the real issue. In the end, they refused to give me a refund, which left me furious. If undercooked bacon and maggots don‚Äôt qualify for a refund, then what does?

I still didn‚Äôt cancel my membership right away, but a week ago, I placed another order that included a rotisserie chicken. When I opened it, it smelled rancid, and part of it was missing. I tried a small piece, and it was completely rotten! I literally couldn‚Äôt get that rotten corpse taste out of my mouth for the rest of the day, no matter what I did. I ended up throwing the whole thing away. Once again, when I reached out to customer service, they said I didn‚Äôt qualify for a refund.

So, I finally canceled my membership. If rotten food and uncooked items aren‚Äôt grounds for a refund, then what is? Has anyone else faced similar issues with Uber Eats? It feels like they‚Äôre just stealing money from us. I didn‚Äôt even contact the restaurant because I believe Uber Eats is responsible for the quality of the food they deliver since they are the ones taking my money.",UberEATS,4,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1grc2nn

1731580609.0,Honest drivers versus thieves versus cancellation rate,"I'll keep it short and sweet. 

After my fourth failed McDonald's pickup this week, due to a driver steeling the food, a conversation with technical support explained to me the following...

They have received hundreds of complaints from drivers about stolen deliveries. 

Cancellation Rate is increased every single time a driver cancels an order or every single time a customer cancels their delivery request. 

On Friday last week, and for most of this year, my cancellation was 1%. Right now, it's sitting at 4% because of thieves.

The solution is simple. 

Anytime an order is stolen and a second or third driver is sent to the restaurant to pick it up. Because the restaurant will refuse to make another of the same order for the same customer, if the driver contacts the customer to verify they have not received their delivery, the driver should have an option in the menu to resubmit the pickup so that the restaurant will be forced to remake the food. Then that same driver can turn around and pick up that order and deliver it. That way the, the honest drivers are not penalized for a thief's actions. The current system is set up to cancel the order and add to that honest driver 's cancellation rate. The customer is disappointed and can complain and a driver is frustrated with having lost the tip and the income and the fuel to get to that restaurant.",UberEATS,32,2,0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gr1zc0/honest_drivers_versus_thieves_versus_cancellation/

1731567209.0,Extremely strange occurrence while doing Uber eats today,"
I got an order for someone at a restaurant. In the order notes it said to call a number for customer support. 

The restaurant had no history of the order so I call the number that the customer listed (stupid mistake, I was just on auto pilot) and it‚Äôs an automated voicemail for an ISP. Now I‚Äôm thinking, ‚Äúdid someone just get my phone number?‚Äù 

I contact Uber support but am on hold for 15 minutes. 

While waiting, I received another order. This order has the exact same instructions saying to call the SAME number that the first one had listed. 

I haven‚Äôt done Uber in forever so I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs some sort of glitch or something. 

I get a voicemail from the second customer saying that they have been waiting 2 hours for their order. I check with the restaurant and they never received an order from the second person either. 

I end up giving up on waiting for Uber support, cancel the orders, and end up calling Uber support to find out what happened later on. 

I explained the situation to FOUR different Uber reps on the phone. The first one says they are going to document it, escalate it, investigate, etc. 

The second has me repeat the entire story to them again and doesn‚Äôt show a record of documentation. She puts me on hold while she figures out what to do. 

After waiting on hold for 5 minutes, the call goes through and someone else picks up. They have no idea who I am or my situation so I explain it a third time and they let me know that they need to transfer me again because they can‚Äôt verify the order details. 

The fourth person is able to verify on their end that sure enough, the same phone number was used in customer instructions. They also let me know that the order was placed BY the restaurant. 

By the restaurant‚Ä¶

But they don‚Äôt have the order on their end‚Ä¶ 

The Uber rep agrees that the situation is weird and promises to escalate, investigate, document, etc. 

After we hang up, I get a standard notification from Uber that my phone conversation was resolved. 

At this point, I‚Äôm thinking that Uber doesn‚Äôt want to document it and investigate it because of liability.

I put in a small grocery order for delivery from Fresh Co. here in Canada, and I ordered two packages of fresh chicken breast. I chose specific items as replacement if they weren't available, but the delivery person did not swap them, and did not message me about the items. I tipped the driver $25 on an $80 order because I felt bad because I added milk to the order after he was already halfway done shopping, and I texted him to apologize about adding the milk in case it caused him any inconvenience, and I made sure I tipped accordingly.  While unpacking the bags just now I pulled out the chicken, and noticed on both packages that there was part of a yellow sticker on each that said ""SAVE NOW! REDUCED FOR QUICK SALE"",with the part of the sticker that the cashier takes removed for them to take. I shop there all the time and I know those stickers are for $3 off each package. The best before date on these items in TOMORROW, and I was still charged the full price. I've never had this happen before, so my question is if this is allowed?

Edit: To clarify, because a commenter thought I was saying the driver scammed me for coupons, that's not the case. I called the store to verify if there was or wasn't any of the fresh, not reduced packages of the chicken I ordered, and the mane said, and I quote, ""Oh yeah, there are TONS out here. I count at least 11 in the display, and there are no reduced ones left at all."", so the driver specifically chose the reduced, expiring tomorrow chicken which I also confirmed with the store were $3 off each package.

Since about 3 months ago, evertytime the restaurant is closed, or the order is stolen by someone else, if i report it as stolen to customer service it affects my cancelation rate. 

I escalated the issue to a supervisor multiple times, they told me two things that shocked me.

One, yes, all cancellations that are done by anyone but the customer or restaurant affect your cancelation rating. Customers and restaurants refuse to cancel because they lose money.

Two, if your cancelation rate is over 20%, you will be deactivated.

So, if 20 of your last 100 trips are stolen, or the restaurant is closed, or the order will take 30+ minutes and you don't want to wait, if you cancel in any of these circumstances *you* as the driver will be deactivated 

This is what I'm not understanding correctly. Isn't that illegal? You cannot fire me, or tear up a contractual agreement with me because you hired idiots that steal orders? Or partner with restaurants that are too incompetent to confirm the pickup? How is that my problem? 

That is *not* grounds for termination of contract. Does anyone know the legality around this?

And I quickly got a ‚Äúyou‚Äôre dead to me‚Äù text from her.  He replied and said she thought it was funny. My daughter‚Äôs text didn‚Äôt surprise me. I could tell she wasn‚Äôt mad 

So took what defaulted to an $8 tip to $25 because he did it and it made my day and made me happy.

My son thinks it‚Äôs wrong I even asked‚Ä¶ because he had to ‚Äúperform‚Äù for me. I actually upped the tip before he even did it because I know some might find it obnoxious. But I love he did and it made me happy. What would you think if you got the his message.

I don't know if it's a driver laziness so they don't have to carry it, or a restaurant making sure 'the drink doesn't get forgotten' and I don't know how to complain about it. 

Do I thumbs down the restaurant? 

Do I thumbs down the driver for bringing it to me like that? 

Do I leave a note that just says ""Do not put cold drink in bag with food"" (I'm assuming from what I've read that they won't take it out for food safety reasons, and don't even see it until dropping off the order anyways)

I know a shout in the void of reddit doesn't really accomplish any change, but I am trying to understand it better. 

Thank you.

**Edit:**  Thanks everyone. I 100% understand it's a restaurant thing. I gave the restaurant 1* chose poorly packed, and put my comments about cold drinks in a warm bag.

I asked if it was the driver cause it was an order where the item was in a bag and the bag was knotted. I was unsure if this was a driver wanted to carry less and put it in the bag and tied a knot in the bag afterwards. There were no safety seals (This seems to be a restaurant thing as the item labels weren't sealing the container shut either. 

I don't usually request these types of drinks, but it was 8:30 at night and I hadn't eaten dinner and just literally wanted some Orange Chicken from Panda, and if I spent $1 more I would hit free delivery so it was cheaper to get the drink than not. They had a $1 for a drink deal at the time. I had plenty of drinks in the fridge and normally don't order them, but I guess a free item means cold food. I used to order water bottle from Canes, but they'd also put it in the bag, so I wound up just ordering a fountain drink instead and poured it out since I was trying to avoid soda. I didn't think this would be the case everywhere. 

I gave the driver a thumbs up and they got a $4.37 tip on a $15 order ($17 because the drink was $3 without the deal to get it for $1).

I also tried to tell them that as a customer, I think some of the rules they've put on drivers are unfair (like the new cancelation thing), and they straight up said ""you're not a driver so we don't care"". 

If I didn't receive the service for ""free"" (included with instacart), I wouldn't use it at all. 

I've never had this many problems with any of the other services. And I know the same people drive for most of them, where I live, so it's gotta be how the different apps/brand work.

My driver last night was not one of my personal regulars, though, and he seemed to be the scammy type - picture and name didn't match (I tried saying ""thank you [name from screen]!"" when it was finally delivered, and they said ""who's [name]?"", so, yeah).

1731223340.0,Just had a 1 hour long heated debate with my friend about tipping etiquette in a gig economy,"I did Uber Eats years ago, before I got into my new profession, and was always of the mindset that 'tipping is not obligatory, but is always appreciated' whenever I was doing my deliveries. That way, I was never disappointed and always knew how much money to expect to make based off the set rates for distance... 

Now that I'm working and making better money, I always tip $3 minimum because I know what a pain in the ass it is to go up 5 flights of stairs when an elevator is out and the person should realistically just meet you in the lobby to be fair. Anyway, my friend has been too lazy for the last week or so and has been ordering delivery constantly, apparently, and since we were hanging out tonight, he ordered for us tonight. I told him, add a $3 tip on for me and I'll give him the change later, and he scoffed, saying how he doesn't tip and me doing so was stupid. 

Basically, his mentality is that of many... Uber adds on multiple fees, so therefore, he shouldn't have to tip his driver, who makes $3 because it isn't his problem or his responsibility to pay Uber's employees a living wage, yet, he'll order twice a day for a week or better. I understand, tips add up, but he obviously isn't hurting, if he can afford to order $650 worth of food in a week... I was just like, what is $1? I tried to explain to him, that many people use delivery services because they're elderly, disabled, or new moms home with a child and that they're dependent on them, so yes, a driver should get a tip, just like a waitress or a bartender because I see them delivering huge grocery orders and if the person ordering is part of Uber Eats+, DoorDash Premium, etc that they aren't getting that $7-$10 delivery fee... This still didn't register with him and his argument was that, it's the stockholders getting rich off the fees, to which I just replied, yes because they're the ones that invest and gave loans to the company and the company should get the majority of the rest of the money because they carry the risk... That is how Capitalism works.

I had hoped that explaining this to him would make him see the light, but no, of course not...

The Uber Eats driver assigned to my order called me and informed me that someone had already picked up my order. He then put the McDonalds manager on the phone and he said 2 people before him had the same order ID and information and that the real UberEats delivery driver was the 3rd person attempting to pick up my order. And they would not make a new order for him. They thought he was lying or I was trying to cause some fraud. The real Uber Eats driver said he would cancel on his side and that I should contact UberEats Customer Service to explain the issue as well.

I quickly called UberEats and informed them of the situation. They cancelled my order and refunded me my money.

So it appears there is some sort of fraud or theft happening between the McDonalds app and Uber Eats.

My guess is that they thought they could swipe my food and my tip ($20).

I now remember why I stopped using the McDonalds application and deleted the UberEats app as well.

I will be sticking with DoorDash or GrubHub from now on.",UberEATS,63,12,0.71,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gnra62/mcdonalds_and_uber_eats_theft_or_fraud_loop_hole/

Hi XXXXX,
My name is Ravali, and I am with the Priority Support team. I am following up on your Better Business Bureau escalation (Complaint ID #22484624).
We‚Äôre sorry to hear about your experience with order# 40E2D. I‚Äôve arranged a refund for your order, which should be returned to your account typically within 3-5 business days.
We have processes in place to review this type of feedback with delivery partners, so your concern hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed.
Further regarding the in-app pricing, I'd like to inform you that when you order through our app, the in-app prices may be different than in-store prices.

We appreciate your understanding and we hope to offer you a better experience on your next order.
Thank you for bringing this to our notice and helping us maintain the quality of the Uber experience.
Please let us know if there is anything further we can help with by responding directly to the message thread in-app.""

1731121068.0,A restaurant being closed or another driver picking up an order now affects our cancelation rate.," I had gone to pick up an order, and the restaurant said that 4 or 5 delivery drivers have already come by to pick up the same order, and the order isn't there. I called Uber support to let them know that the order had already been picked up so they could cancel it on their end. The representative told me that  I could just cancel it on my end. I asked if it would affect my cancelation rate, and she said only a little bit. I told her as far as I know, when someone has already picked up an order or if the restaurant is closed, Uber support can cancel it on there end so it doesn't affect our cancelation rate and we get compensated for driving to the location to pick up the order.  She pretty much avoided what I was asking and kept telling me I just need to do more deliveries to bring the percentage down. 

Anyway, I ended up calling again to speak with someone else. The 2nd representative was really nice. He said he also thinks it's not fair for the drivers to cancel an order that isn't available to be picked up. However, those are the new guidelines, and it's out of their control.

So, moving forward, we have to be the ones to call the customer and have them cancel their order so it doesn't affect our rates.

I tried calling the restaurant and there was no answer. Google says it's temporarily closed. Their national website says it temporarily closed. UE is still taking orders. We go for a bit of a drive after 5pm - yep, it's definitely closed. Nothing is being delivered from there for a while. 

We send photos and screenshots to UE, but they have refused a refund because of a previous refunded order (yeah, our local KFC is the worst).

Despite reminding them of their legal obligations to actually provide a service or a refund, apparently *their decision is final*. Seemingly, UK law does not apply to Uber Eats. And they don't seem keen on providing a UK phone number or postal address either, which makes it difficult to challenge Uber Eats any further.

I fantasised about starting a small claims court claim, winning, and eventually getting bailiffs to go and collect goods from their offices. But once I calmed down, I concluded that a bank chargeback would have to suffice.

Because I compared it with Doordash, ordering the exact same items, from the exact same restaurant... 

The checkout total was exactly the same between the two... while Uber Eats ""Claims"" to have ""applied"" your 40% off and even shows a discounted amount... and Doordash did not.... 

Not only but I can select to remove the promotional discount, and the price goes back UP an extra 40% so its HIGHER then Doordash.

No thank you Uber Eats... you can keep this Scam... I'll stick to using Doordash, they're quicker anyway.",UberEATS,6,0,0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gm3dbn/40_off_your_next_3_orders/

1731009910.0,How I know it‚Äôs not the drivers stealing food ,"When I first started this gig pretty much every restaurant left the food out for us to pick up. Now the only ones left who do are digital kitchens. These are places the average person wouldn‚Äôt know it existed unless they were a driver.  Only people in and out of there are drivers and I‚Äôve never showed up to a stolen order there.  

Yet the restaurants where most ‚Äòdriver theft‚Äô seems to happen is cheap fast food places.  We pick up from nice restaurants all the time. Why would we steal $10 worth of Wendy‚Äôs?  

Another clue it‚Äôs not the drivers is the evolution of the interaction with these restaurants and fast food places.  After they started putting behind counter they eliminated any random opportunists taking the food.  They started asking us for names to verify and all was good for 6 months or so.  Then all of a sudden stolen orders start happening again and the restaurants start asking us to show our phones. Now why would the name not be good enough for the restaurant.  Because there is another person out there that knows the name - the customer. 

IMO most stolen orders come from 1 of 3 things. 

1) customer orders what he wants. picks it up himself and claims refund from uber when it‚Äôs not delivered. 

2) restaurant worker messes up in some way.  Hands order to wrong driver and gets delivered to wrong person (kind of on driver too but not malicious theft either).  Forgets to make it.  Something‚Ä¶ they won‚Äôt admit fault because these are mostly younger people working these places not wanting to get in trouble. 

3) some technical difficulty the order is never made. Shift change or role change in restaurant.  New person has no clue why they don‚Äôt have it and assumes another driver took it. Since that‚Äôs the trope on social media 

I‚Äôd say the 4th likelihood scenario is a driver took it.   Maybe has decided to quit. Doesn‚Äôt care about deactivation anymore and says F it and take dinner home with him on his last day. But we‚Äôre not taking Wendy‚Äôs trust me. They‚Äôre taking some steaks home with them the last day ",UberEATS,48,4,0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1glzot6/how_i_know_its_not_the_drivers_stealing_food/

1730954750.0,UberEats customer service completely unusable now,"Hey everyone,  
  
I wanted to tell this story because I've been a long-time user of UberEats and I've noticed in just 12 months the customer service has gone from fine to completely unusable.

I ordered two pizzas from them a couple of nights ago, and when it arrived, it was one pizza and it was the wrong pizza. So half the pizzas, and also, not our order anyway.

I tried to use the auto-pop up menu in the UberEats app to flag I hadn't got my order, but instead, they just kept asking if I wanted to cancel my order. They said if I cancelled I would pay **the entire cost of the order I hadn't got as a ""service fee.""**

This happened over and over again in a loop, until I asked to speak to a human agent. Finally, I spoke to someone, they checked the order and then said someone would get back to me within 24 hours.

Just to be clear - I was standing at my door, $60 poorer, without my food and I was being told that someone would get back to me within 24 hours.

Better yet - **no one got back to me!** Ever. Not in the app. Not in my emails. Not in spam. Nowhere. They took my money and ran, without ever giving me my order or contacting me again.

Utterly unusable and reprehensible. Obviously I'm now never using it again, I'll switch to a competitor, but I just wanted to warn everyone.

They then sit about 2 blocks away for about 10 minutes while the order stays as ‚Äúwrapping up‚Äù when I looked at the app again a little bit later, the driver is now in another part of town not moving and the order is still ‚Äúwrapping up‚Äù

 I wait some more and now after about 40 minutes after I placed the order, I messaged the driver asking if everything was okay.

I keep the map open next to me and then all of a sudden they start driving and the order changes from ‚Äúwrapping up‚Äù to ‚Äúon the way‚Äù, mysteriously without the driver going back to the restaurant.

Update: my bank has reversed the charge after I supplied evidence of both the food and conversations with Uber. The health and safety regulations for food has responded and will start and official investigation. Hope that disgusting restaurant is shut down. 

Ordered food last week from a Thai place which I later found out was a ghost kitchen. A few bites in I noticed the consistency of the chicken was weird. Went to investigate properly and it was fking RAW. Took photos and immediately uploaded it to Uber eats. I was so put off I threw the rest of the food away. One day later I ended up with severe food poisoning.

Spoke to Uber eats in chat, so rude and useless. Told me I'm not entitled to a refund because apparently I have had multiple. The last time I requested a refund was in 2022 for burnt charcoal pizza!! Ended up contacting them through the phone using riders support as we don't have a phone customer service line in the UK. The guy on the phone shouted at me and hung up on me. Tried calling the restaurant, exact same thing. I was shouted at and accused of lying by a guy who barely spoke English. Meanwhile I haven't eaten for 6 days now because I'm still nauseous. 

I swear to god i'm so petty and will report this to food safety regulations and the local news papers. If anyone has any other tips please let me know. Fck Uber eats, NEVER AGAIN. ",UberEATS,138,61,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gkgp04/im_so_angry/

1730774570.0,The scam‚Ä¶,"I placed an order with Uber eats from Wendy‚Äôs
2 Spicy chicken Sandwiches 
2 Fries
1 Small Diet Coke
1 Small Coke Zero

The delivery person was suppose to drop the food off at the hotel room. The room number was provided in the delivery instructions along with my phone number in case the deliverer needed assistance in being allowed to different floors, or walking past the hotel lobby. 

Instead of going to the room, or even going to the front desk he sent a message saying ‚Äú I am here‚Äù, he never said messaged anything after. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming‚Äù and was in from of him with two minutes as he was walking into the hotel lobby. He was holding two drinks, and when I asked him for the remainder of the order he said that‚Äôs what the restaurant handed him‚Ä¶

I told him he would need to go back because my order had 6 items and not 2, he then called someone on his phone, and that person (on speaker was yelling in another language. He then said show me the receipt, and when I  navigated to the order receipt (he must have seen the confirmation code, which I later realize) I also told him he would need to go the restaurant and get the remaining order as I did not only order 2 drinks. He said he wouldn‚Äôt and left with the 2 items (drinks) he arrived with (instead of the 6 originally placed on the order). I attempted to reach out to customer support to cancel the order and the first agent said:

‚ÄúAs I have checked the delivery person contacted you multiple times waited for you for more than 8 minutes and delivered the food to your correct location. however, you are not eligible for a refund.‚Äù

I contested and said that ‚Äúhe did not ‚Äú.  I think he said my confirmation code and made them believe that my order was delivered.

I was livid. No food, starving past midnight, and being told that I was in the wrong (the deliver probably did something to my food ( keep it , give it to someone else, etc.) but then proceeded to make me out to be the villain‚Ä¶

The first agent  kicked me out of the chat, then second said and did the same. The most infuriating part is when they would say this before ending the chat:

‚ÄúI have provided you the best resolution/information we have for your concern right now. Since we are unable to offer any further resolution, we are closing this chat for now. Stay safe and healthy. Thank you for using our chat support. Have a nice day.‚Äù Before ending the chat. 

I wanted to deck them ü•ä 

I contacted the hotel lobby and asked if they have video recordings of the entrance and they do. I was able to get video footage of everything I described. I contacted Uber support one more time and mentioned that I have video to support that I never received my order and simply just want a refund. The third agent said the same that the driver followed the guidelines, I asked them to clarify what guidelines they are referring to. No answer provided. The deliverer took a blank black picture as ‚Äúproof‚Äù the order was completed. I let the third agent know that I have video evidence of them returning with the two items he brought instead of the correct complete order. (Keep in mind that the total was $35 including a tip, which this deliverer was keeping). 
The third agent proceeds to tell me:

‚ÄúWe understand this is not the response you were expecting.
However, we won't be able to provide you with a price adjustment on this order.‚Äù

I was so drained that I just going to close the chat and deal with it in the morning by disputing the charge with my cc company and submitting the video as proof. 

I told the agent specifically that, ‚ÄúI have video footage from the hotel lobby of this exchange from 10/31/24 at seeing around 12:16 am‚Ä¶.‚Äù
I also drafted this summary and asked the following questions: 
‚ÄúI attempted to reach out to two agents prior to simply request a refund and they said that the delivery person followed guidelines‚Ä¶
How?
He never got all the items from the order
He didn‚Äôt not follow instructions of ‚Äúleave it at the door, room XYZ‚Äù
He saw over my shoulder, the order confirmation and possibly confirmed the order
He did not return to the restaurant to attempt completing the order (getting the remaining 4 items)
He lied about the interaction
I have video surveillance footage of the interaction from the hotel lobby, provided by the hotel to support the fact I never received any items from this delivery person.

One last thing, I have stellar ratings with Uber eats and would not be pursuing this if I didn‚Äôt feel scammed.
I simply want my refund. 

Their proof of delivery is a black picture, I have video footage of them leaving with the two items from the incorrect order‚Ä¶‚Äù

Finally they responded with:
‚ÄúThank you for waiting, I am happy to inform you that the team has considered this request and normally we don't provide
compensation in these cases, I can understand your situation, and I would like to process a full refund for this order.‚Äù

I figured good pay rates would come through because many people don't want to drive tonight. It seemed I was right. The first order to come in payed more than $2 per mile. This seems fair for hazard pay. I drive miles through the storm to this popular local taco join to pick up the food and am told 'another driver picked up the order'. What this means is that the restaurant workers didn't ensure confirmation of pickup, allowing the first assigned driver to steal the food -_- I contact support but they can't help and the cancelation goes against my account as a demerit. 20 of those and I'm fired/deactivated. Even if it's not my fault. 

I head home and a 2nd order comes through also paying well, and from the same restaurant. I shouldn't have accepted it, but I did. I turn around and drive a few miles back to this restaurant, and this time all the workers laugh in my face saying it has already been picked up. They think it's hilarious. Even the cooks laughing when the window worker shared the news to everybody. I couldn't deal with another cancelation against my account along with everybody making fun of me so I made a bad choice. I asked for a $1 drink and a bag. I put the drink in the bag and ""ghost delivered"" it to the customer. Took a photo of the ""full"" bag in front of the customers door and received the entire $20 rate instead of taking a cancelation and not getting paid plus potentially being deactivated/fired.

I don't want to steal from customers. But because another driver stole the customers food and the restaurant workers won't do anything to stop it I was just fed up. Go ahead and down vote me and say rude things to me, but this is just bullsh*t. Uber will fire/deactivate us because somebody else steals food, and there is nothing we can do about it. Even if support cancels the ride, the cancelation goes against the driver.

I was driving, so I didn't text back, but the customer kept insisting I cancel, which I didn't.

I arrived at the destination, which seemed to be a closed gas station and no restaurant in sight. I checked the order, and it was for one singular drink, worth $3.

At this point, I suspected this was a scheme for something suspicious. I confirmed the order and drove to a nearby store to purchase the item before it got canceled automatically.

Uber informed me that the order could be disposed of, and I was paid in full.

1730695763.0,I think Uber is playing chess while customers and drivers are playing checkers.,"And they‚Äôre being a grandmaster strategist. We‚Äôre constantly seeing arguments between customers and drivers. Drivers claiming lack of tips and customers feeling they paid enough of fees for them not to tip. As someone who has driven and orders from, both are absolutely true. As a driver you constantly see orders with no tip or little ones with 5+ miles. It‚Äôs not worth your time, gas, wear and tear on your vehicle. At the same time, as a customer, Uber tacks you on fees that drive up your $15 order to $25. Naturally as a customer you wouldn‚Äôt feel inclined to tip more or anything. So what happens? That order shows up as a $2 for X amount of miles for the driver. What‚Äôs happening in the process? Uber is wiping their hands clean. Screw over the driver and customer. Pitting us against each other knowing that drivers will complain with the lack of tips because Ubers base pay was trash. And customers blaming drivers for not getting their orders on time or late because it was grouped with multiple orders. Uber is a corporation and like any other, its employees are just a number waiting to be replaced by another. And all they care about from the customer is their money and how to squeeze the most from them. 

I‚Äôve honestly become tired of arguing for both sides with past posts. We‚Äôre literally on the same team and should be focusing on the actual problem of which is Uber. I‚Äôve only scratched the surface on Ubers scummy practices but I just hope in the near future we can start holding Uber accountable.

Had a double pickup, same customer order this morning. Picked up the pancakes from IHOP and went to McDonald's for the second pickup which was two iced coffees. Cashier bagged the drinks and was about to hand it to me but some manager or supervisor stepped up and took it from her, saying I need a insulated Doordash bag or I won't be allowed to pick up. 

Restaurant instructions has nothing about bags, and I've never had an issue before with them. Told the supervisor I'm not with Doordash, it's ubereats and I'm just a pickup driver. She says she doesn't care, it's all the same, and I need to have a bag or I need to leave and cancel the order so another driver can pick up. 

I straight up asked if she was having a powertripping episode over this right now? I'm not a minimum wage cook, I'm doing this on my spare time, I'll text the customer and wait all you need. 

Supervisor gave in and handed me the drinks, warning me I can't return unless I have a bag. 

So I complete the drop-off, go offline and call uber. It turns out even though I haven't registered a delivery bag in the driver's app, I can still be matched to restaurants that require a bag, and they are allowed to ask me to cancel. But they also told me to call before canceling and they'll cancel for me and provide compensation. They also removed the negative rating McDonald's left. So that's nice.

1730675756.0,Uber Eats Chaotic Customer Service Experience ,"Today, in Greenville County, SC, I ordered via Uber Eats, placing the order at 12:00pm. 

Shortly after placing the order, the Uber Eats tracker showed my driver stopping at the restaurant I‚Äôd ordered from, about 12:10-12:15pm. 
The driver then proceeded to drive to a neighborhood opposite my direction, and then to transfer my order to a different driver. 

40-50minutes later, the second driver transfers my order back to the original driver. 

2 hours after my order had been placed, driver no. 1 called to tell me that the restaurant was ‚Äúclearly closed on Sundays,‚Äù so I‚Äôd have to cancel. 

I was grateful not to be charged for the food I didn‚Äôt get for this order, but had been forced to wait on an order for two hours, although the driver could have told me the restaurant was closed within 15 minutes of my placing the order at 12pm. 

Chatted with customer service. They said that they had done all that could be done, no explanation, no accountability, no compensation for this mishap of negligence. 

But, wait! The story isn‚Äôt even over yet! 

I then placed a second order from a different restaurant via UberEats.
The food was soggy, we didn‚Äôt receive one of our drinks. We got compensated 5 dollars for this, but the total for those items was $11.29. I‚Äôm grateful for the $5 Uber Eats credit. 

Our driver (not either of the two from earlier), came to bring us the order and My brother answered the door. Driver refused to speak at all. The driver also refused a $9 tip in cash, rolling their eyes, turning around and leaving. 

As I pulled into the driveway, the driver was backing out of my driveway but stopping for 2-3 seconds and then moving forward again. I thought she might have just been arriving, and couldn‚Äôt find the house because this happens a lot where I live. I pulled up and rolled down my passenger window to ask if she needed help finding the house, but before I could finish asking, she said to me angrily ‚ÄúIM JUST TRYING TO BACK OUT!‚Äù I said ‚ÄúOk, I apologize.‚Äù 
Then she stared at me angrily for 2-3 seconds, then began backing her car while saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to back out! God! Leave Me Alone!‚Äù 
I didn‚Äôt say anything else to the driver. Just waited quietly for her to pull out.

An actual phone call. Uber contacted me apologizing for the discrepancy. They explained I was correct, their customer service agents I spoke with would be trained again on how to handle this issue. 
Basically she explained that when applying a promo, it happened somehow. Tech was notified about it. Apparently it's not uncommon either because I've seen multiple posts online about the same issue for months now. I guess most people don't hear anything back unless they raise a big enough stink about it. 

They apologized to me, corrected the discrepancy, and told me they'd fix the issue so it doesn't happen again. I'm not going to use it again though it's not worth it to me. I hope this can be of help in the future to anyone going through similar. 


EBT is accepted on their platform. Multiple times now they've refused EBT for items with the icon that the store and EBT verified were eligible. 

When I reach out to customer service to figure out why, they basically string me along with a bunch of bullsh!t saying that my items must not have been approved, but then can't tell me what terms weren't. They'll disconnect, they'll tell me ""call your bank"". But my bank, and EBT card, tell me that it needs to be brought up with my receipt to the point of purchase. When I show them this they act like they didn't see my screenshots or read what I said at all. Basically just throwing me to the next agent and then acting like they can't do anything about it. They even try to tell me my receipt from them is incorrect but they can't give me a correct one.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Ok, let me understand what happened here.

I put an order in for a few items from Sainsbury‚Äôs. I see in the app that the delivery is split between two riders. The first one arrives relatively fast and delivers about 30 percent of the order. He tells me that the remainder of the order is coming with another rider, asks me my PIN which i tell him, and leaves. I check the app and see the other rider is about 5 minutes behind. I check the tracking map after about 3-4 minutes and i can see the other rider about 50m away from my apartment building, i keep my eyes on the map as it struck me as interesting that albeit shown being on a scooter (not bike), he is going the wrong way in a one way street. The driver seems static on the map for some time and after a couple of minutes the tracking screen disappears on the app and i get a notification that my order was complete.

I click ‚Äúhelp‚Äù on the app and get connected to the driver. Although i have i note female in the driver‚Äôs picture, a male voice picks up. I ask him where is my order and he says ‚Äúsorry brother, i went to Sainsbury‚Äôs and they told me that the first driver picked up everything‚Äù

Understanding there is no point in engaging in a conversation with him i hang up the phone to try to get some help from Uber Eats support. I explained the situation to them over texts, sending pictures of the items that arrived and sending screenshots from the receipt having marked all the items that are missing.

Can someone explain how this scam works? Were the drivers working together? How did the second driver ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù the order without my PIN? Did the other driver give it to him?

What are my chances of getting a refund for all this?? It feels really shitty being thieved of about 50 pounds worth of stuff.

I placed my order and indicated which items I would not want replaced if they're not in stock at the store. A driver took my order and once at the store indicated to me that smaller pack of spinach and dressing was not available -- I had indicated I would rather a refund than the replacement item. He then continues to bombard me with 5 requests to replace the items with suggestions from Uber, I declined all of them. After 30-35 minutes, when I received my delivery, I see a large pack of organic arugula and a completely random large jar of sauce in the bag. The surcharge was almost $20. Im a broke college student, so thats a lot for me. When I asked the support staff if theres anything they can do, they said ""our regulations don't allow such practices and we take your concern seriously"". BS!

And can drivers see ‚Äúhistory‚Äù? For example, I live in a pretty large town but I always get the same two drivers‚Ä¶ I was wondering if maybe they accept the order because of my location. I always think it‚Äôs awesome because they are both really great delivery drivers (they will text me when they are on their way or if there is traffic slowing them down etc‚Ä¶ They worked through a hurricane and delivered food to me several days when I didn‚Äôt have power and I tipped extra, of course) I also have a disability which makes it hard for me to go out sometimes when my disease is in flare. I swear, UberEats delivery has saved me from a lot of hassle.

1.

This method doesn't work and makes my food take so long that it is cold and soggy by the time it gets to my door.

2. I don't get updated when my order is taking longer than expected and the wait time just keeps updating getting longer and longer every time I open the app....like have some transparency. 

3. Customer service means absolutely nothing to these companies and you have to fight your way through an incompetent robot just to speak to an agent and even then they seem incapable of unwilling  to give you any reasonable reason or solution.

UE was offering a promo of  40% off at a particular grocery, so my partner and I chose food from this chain and placed the order. 

For reasons unknown to me, the order was late - driver headed to store at around 8:30am (when I checked the app/screenshots show), he pays for order at 9:50am (per store receipt) and delivers at approx. 10:15am. The total (including gratuity) was $59.37 which was charged to our credit card. 

Today, we looked at our online banking and see two charges from UberEats:
1. The original charge of $59.37 (pending) and 
2. An additional charge of $86.97 (what the order would have been on UberEats without the discount).

We‚Äôve messaged with 3 different CSRs, and not one can give a legit reason for the additional charge/change in price. Each continues to ask for a screenshot of the coupon that was originally applied and that they can‚Äôt help us without it.

Well I placed my order by 6:30PM, left a good tip, immediately was assigned to a driver, however, the driver was doing a double order. I did not get my food until 8:10PM tonight!! 

These delivery food apps are extremely expensive for the customer! And it's honestly so wrong that uber doubles up orders and often delivers to the person who ordered the food first, last. Making all the money spent essentially not worth it.

I had this issue last night delivering when I did my first double uber eats order, the lady who I picked up for first was getting ice and I wasn't going to reach her house for another hour so I called customer service to see if I could go to her address first but they said no! Luckily her ice was fine, but I'm not going to be accepting double orders anymore unless it's super low miles and I unfortunately probably won't be ordering off Uber Eats again, because you never know if the driver you get is going to be getting a double order or not.

Honestly after like 30 seconds of no answer I shoulda figured I was at the wrong place and also the lady was indian and had a very indian name and the door i was at had a calavera decoration for dia de los muertos. I'm not trying to sound racially ignorant but I've grown up around both hispanics and indians and indians usually don't celebrate Dia De Los Muertos from my personal experience, and the addresses WERE labelled on each different section, so it was partly my fault that I almost got her order stolen but I feel like less of an idiot knowing I'm not the only driver who's done that, also I feel like her neighbors are truly terrible ppl, cause talking to her she seemed like a really nice women, she was very understanding and wasn't mad at me at all, also it was a very nice complex, you'd have to make quite a bit of money to live there, meaning theres most likely no real need for them to steal food.

1730522641.0,Things that grind my gears as a driver,"1. People who text me redundant information when I am about to deliver.

Examples ""Hey, it's apartment #xxx"" or ""Hey, my apartment complex name is xxx"". 

This information should already be in the description for the order. Please don't text me, I don't particularly want to hear from you. The app will also read it to me interrupting my music which is super annoying.

I'm fine with special requests or other information that is not on the description for delivery. Drivers can't see notes prior to confirming pick up so that would be fine.

2. Poor tippers that say ""thank you so much"". I do this for money not for your thanks. If you're really thankful leave a better tip next time.

3. Poor tippers that Iive in high rises. Especially those that won't answer when you have a problem getting to their apt. Or those that have a pin and won't answer when you get to their door. Why set a pin if you aren't going to be available to receive your order?

4. Poor tippers that are tracking my location during a stacked order because they are poor tippers. I've gotten things like ""Are you driving?"" and ""I don't see you moving to my location.""

Tip better so that your order is less likely to be stacked and you receive your food faster.

5. Poor tippers.

1730520388.0,  Can someone please explain to me what just happened here?,"  I just received an offer to be paid $31.07 for a food delivery from Sonic.  I went to Sonic but they said the order was already picked up by someone else, which I don‚Äôt get how that should be possible considering Uber doesn‚Äôt let another Uber driver choose the same pick up you chose.  It should say ‚ÄúThis trip is no longer available‚Äù or something like that, if another Uber driver deliverer accepts the trip before you can accept it, so if I accepted it no other Uber driver should have been able to do so.  So I am confused there.  I even asked the customer ‚ÄúDid someone else already pick up your order?  The restaurant just told me someone else did already.‚Äù  The customer then said ‚ÄúNo, not to my knowledge.‚Äù  So I showed the messages to the employee there, but he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to tell ya.  There‚Äôs nothing I can do about correcting the issue on our end.  The customer might just have to cancel the order and redo it or something.‚Äù  I told the customer that that‚Äôs what the restaurant then told me to tell them to do, and then the customer said ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù cancelled the order, then I waited for them to redo it.  But I guess the customer decided not to try again because I have not received any new Uber trip notifications since.  This was like 25 minutes ago, and that customer probably got upset and decided to not try again.  

  I am highly disappointed and confused all at the same time.  Every time you accept a trip, it shouldn‚Äôt let another driver accept it.  Every time a trip has been accepted by another driver, it always tells me ‚ÄúThis trip is no longer available‚Äù which I see all the time I‚Äôm doing Uber!  How could have someone else gotten the same trip?  Even the customer didn‚Äôt receive any notifications of another driver picking up their order for delivery!  I have no idea what just happened!

1730509403.0,No tip + negative review justified?,"I had ordered food, driver went to the wrong address (the next neighbourhood over) and left it at the same house number as mine. ""Its late, and maps must have screwed him over"" I thought to myself, so I called him, 5, times. All of my calls went straight to voicemail, no way to contact him. Ended up walking to a strangers' house at 1 am, and getting my food, left no tip and gave a negative review on the driver. Was this justified? I would have happily given a tip if he had picked up the phone and figured it out with me but having your phone off is unacceptable.

Edit addition: Uber also refunded my order after I clicked on the 'didn't receive my order' button for the 10th time, so I'm pretty happy with that as I have heard a lot of horror stories about Uber's refund policy.

Edit 2: Ordered again, same issue, verbatim. Same door as before, inability to call driver. There isn't even a road that leads to my house on the Uber map anymore, I'm just in a block in some uncharted territory I guess (Yes my location is set right, I can literally see my house and my pointer is in it).

1730496729.0,Fake Delivery Alert - My Uber Eats Nightmare!!,"Just wanted to share a pretty frustrating experience I recently had with Uber Eats that left me both disappointed and baffled. It‚Äôs crazy how some people think they can get away with dishonesty!

So, I placed an order and was eagerly waiting for my delivery. The driver was supposed to drop it off at my building, but instead, he went to the next building over. He took a photo of my order being ""delivered"" there and then took the food with him!

When I checked the delivery photo, I noticed it was taken in front of the wrong building ‚Äì not even mine! What‚Äôs even more bizarre was that there was no buzzer code ring‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt even try to reach me.  
Thinking it was a simple mix-up, I tried to call the driver, hoping he‚Äôd realize the mistake and swing back. At first, he denied anything was wrong, insisting he had delivered it to the right place. After a bit of back and forth, he suddenly blocked my number, leaving me with no food, no way to reach him, and a lot of frustration.  
  
Luckily, the building he tried to attempt fake delivery, shares the same management as mine. The office staff were incredibly helpful and managed to track down what had really happened.

What frustrates me is that incidents like this can unfairly lead to the entire Indian community being blamed for the actions of a few individuals. It‚Äôs disappointing to see hardworking people judged because of the misdeeds of others. It‚Äôs a shame that a few individuals tarnish the reputation of a whole group.

1730489857.0,UberEats has Shadow banned me from Refunds / Reporting Issues with Orders.,"TL/DR at the end.

I work crazy hours and I use UberEats all the time and I have been for at least 8 or so yrs, I know.. unhealthy, expensive etc. I am aware and I generally order healthier options and I do have a decent job which allows me to spend the extra on ordering in. I also use Uber to get to and from work 4 days a week, every week.

Anyway, my issue.

As I said I use UberEats a lot. So I'm bound to have orders that are messed up. Missing items, wrong items, incorrect toppings, etc (main issue is completely missing items).

Example: I'll order a combo and I'll be missing the side or the drink or an extra sandwich or burger.

I'm a person that believes I should receive what I pay for. So, when I'm completely missing an item I'm going to justifiably report this as missing. I will specifically pick JUST the missing item and put through that it's missing. I'll gladly take Uber Cash or a refund, doesn't matter. But if I'm missing what I paid for I expect it to be refunded.

Well, I noticed that a lot of times instead of just refunding the say $5 item out of a $20+ order, they will refund the ENTIRE ORDER. I have specifically stated in my missing item requests even ""EVERYTHING ELSE WAS FINE PLEASE DO NOT REFUND OTHER ITEMS"" and they will refund my entire order still.

Now, I have worked in a similar field in the past and I know things like this could flag my account as taking advantage of refunds or something like that. So, I have even called the customer support line and spoke to 3rd level supervisors at least 4-5 times to tell them this keeps happening and I DO NOT WANT the entire order refunded, I only expect the missing item to be refunded.

Shadow Ban?

So now no matter what my issue is if I report a missing item, wrong item (completely wrong order even) etc I instantly get declined anything, it tells me I'm not eligible for a refund for my missing item and just closes the door on it. Then I have to reach out to chat support and all they do is send that same copy and pasted message over and over and over to me and do nothing. Even if I have photos to support the issue.

So now, no matter what I could get a completely wrong order or be missing an item I have no recourse to have it corrected.

What am I supposed to do? I just had an order that was $45 and it was completely wrong, I sent an image etc and they just completely deny my refund and no one here will eat the food we did receive.

**TL/DR:**

**The restaurants in my area constantly mess up orders and I get missing items about 10% to 20% of the time, over the years this has built up enough reports / refund requests due to this that I believe I'm shadow banned from even requesting refunds. I spend at least $1000 a month w/ Uber between travel to work and food. My refunds are now instantly denied and tells me I'm not eligible even when the order is completely wrong w/ photos etc. Chat support copy and pastes a denial response and does nothing.**",UberEATS,26,0,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1ghdwtp/ubereats_has_shadow_banned_me_from_refunds/
1730489788.0,UberEats Driver Stole My Lunch!,"Today, I placed an online order with a local sandwich shop that uses UberEats drivers to deliver meals. After 90 minutes of not receiving my meal, I called the shop and was told that the UberEats driver picked it up already.

1730423993.0,Walmart Ghost Deliveries ,"Just when I was ready to log off and call it quits for the day. I had a Walmart offer for $58.19. It was for 5 different customers going only 21 miles total. I tapped it as quickly as I saw it and made the turn to head toward Walmart, 4 miles from my location. 

At a red light, I previewed the order information. It looked like it was something very reasonable to do for that amount of money. 

1 mile from Walmart, the app chimed the canceled order notification. A sense of disappointment flowed through me but I figured I still had at least 4 orders and would likely still make at least 40 bucks.

Three blocks from Walmart, the app chimed the canceled order notification yet again. Followed less than a block down by a third canceled order. Now. I was starting to get concerned. 

As I was pulling into the parking lot of Walmart to pick up their last two remaining orders, they canceled order chime happened again. I was at this point quite disturbed or at least mildly upset.

I realized that that $58.19 was long gone. 

I proceeded to check in and wait for the Walmart employee to come out with the order. 

And then a thought occurred to me. 99% of all Walmart delivery offers are at most $2 to $3 including tip, driving to three or four locations over a distance of 10 to 20 mi. 

Maybe it was paranoia that made me think that perhaps Uber had decided to start tricking us by offering multiple deliveries for a huge tip amount and then deleting them one by one as described above. Could it even be a thing? Would they stoop so low just to deliver a non-paying zero tip delivery? 

I wouldn't bet on it, nor would I bet against it.

And then the Walmart employee showed up without any cart or merchandise or groceries. I rolled down my window and the woman told me that the orders that I was supposed to pick up had already been picked up by someone else. A full hour before I arrived. 

I mentioned to her that I initially had five deliveries. She nodded and said that all five deliveries were picked up by that same driver an hour ago. She told me that all five customers had called her asking where the hell their stuff was. That they couldn't get in touch with Uber or the driver who picked it up. 

This is why it is so infuriating and frustrating as hell for drivers who have honesty and integrity who arrive to pick up something that someone else took and stole. 

My mind went places that were unjustified yet were a completely logical conclusion based on what I have read in various postings in this forum. 

I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal five sets of groceries from Walmart. 

I would hope that Uber is going to take some serious steps against this thief, if not just in the defense of the customers or Walmarts, but in the defense of the drivers who work with integrity and honesty.",UberEATS,7,7,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1ggu9ln/walmart_ghost_deliveries/

1730388609.0,I got a shitty driver am I wrong for removing tip?,"
Hey, Reddit folks! So I ordered 4 items from PetSmart on Uber Eats: cat dewormer, cat ear drops, dog treats, and canned food. The store‚Äôs only 4 miles away, and I tipped $26. Right after the shopper started, items were marked out of stock, leaving only the canned food available‚Äîwhich felt odd. Then he started making strange replacements: he tried to replace cat ear drops with dog hot spot spray and the dewormer with a cat stress spray! I told him right away I didn‚Äôt want that, but he must have been at checkout already because I couldn‚Äôt decline it.

At this point, I was suspicious and irritated so I called the store. I asked about the stock in regards to my uber eats order. The employee asked if I ordered dewormer and cat ear drops. When I said yes, she said they were in stock at the front and that the shopper actually knew this, as he had asked about them before but still ignored it. Apparently, he pulls this all the time and just grabs whatever. She said there wasn‚Äôt much they could do but would talk to her manager.

Uber Eats support was no help, either. They said I could cancel but would be charged the full amount. When the guy arrived, I asked him why he didn‚Äôt grab the right items, mentioning that the store had previous complaints about him. He claimed it was his first time there but it was so clear he was lying and he was extremely defensive and combative, but the employee described him perfectly.

What would you have done? Should I have left the tip? I usually get great service because I tip well, and I‚Äôm wondering how he even got my order in the first place!

1730374652.0,Wendy's ,"Imagine this...

You've been driving all night. You stop at a hotel and check in. You're hungry but it's 5:00 in the morning. You hop in the shower, dry off, and sit down on the bed in your hotel room. You open up the Uber app and order Wendy's. You look out your hotel room window and there's a Wendy's 20 yd away but you're too tired to walk over and they don't unlock their dine-in doors for 2 hours. 

You place an order for Wendy's on your Uber app and then you kick back and relax. Waiting for the driver to show up. 

You check your order status after 5 minutes and see that, for some reason, the driver is 20 minutes away with your food. 

You receive a text from the driver when their car shows on the map that they are at your hotel. But it's been a half hour since your shower. You're exhausted. 

Now imagine you're the driver for Uber. You receive an offer to take a delivery for 9 mi for $12. Not too bad. So yeah, grab the Wendy's, hop on the expressway, avoid the toll roads that would add $10 to your delivery cost, and arrive at the hotel. 

And then you text the customer, get no reply, you wait 4 minutes and try again with no reply. You phone the customer and it goes straight to voicemail. And it's a secure hotel with the closed reception desk and no unlocked door. 

The 8-minute timer runs down on the delivery pin required order, and it says to leave it in a safe place and take a photo. 

This just happened to me as a driver. 
I can understand the customer's point of view. 
When I drove those 9 mi and arrived just over 20 minutes after the customer placed the order, my eyes went wide and my jaw dropped when I pulled into the parking lot of the hotel and saw Wendy's within easy walking distance.

I followed the instructions in the app and pulled in through the Pharmacy drive through. There were two cars before me, so I wait maybe 3-5 minutes. Pull up to the drive through and see the pharmacy workers doing pharmacy work, and not giving me a single glance. I wait another couple of minutes. I see cars backing up behind me. I wonder if I'm supposed to notify the employees, seeing as they're still not looking at me. I push the button to notify them, and they tell me they'll be with me in a moment. I wait for another 7 minutes, while the pharmacy folk continuing to ignore me. 

I'm queued up to pick up another delivery, so I'm getting very annoyed. I give up my place in the queue and I go inside. The front checkout (nearly empty) confirms the pharmacy is where Uber deliveries should be picked up, so I walk back. At least 4 more people are waiting inline for the pharmacy inside the store. 

Looking back now, I probably should have seen if they would at least hand me the Uber package, but at the time I felt so frustrated. I canceled the pickup, hoping that I could still get my next order. Which I couldn't. The Walgreens pickup took so long that someone else grabbed my next order, so I arrived to find nothing.

I don't blame the pharmacy workers, tbh. They were clearly overwhelmed. But I am wondering who the hell at Walgreens decided that having pickups at the pharmacy was a good idea? 

I'm really pissed off that I missed my order queued up after Walgreens...Is there anyone who knows if I can make a complaint in the UberEats app for how Walgreens directed Uber drivers? I'm not hopeful that I'll get compensation for a missed delivery...but I'd like to encourage Walgreens to make a better pickup direction for future drivers. What do other drivers think?

I contacted Uber's support via chat, but they informed me they couldn't cancel the order either, as it was an ""automated"" process and outside their control.

I talked to my provider and he says the people who's name is in the registration gets their name in it. Even though for that I am the primary driver

Insurance company do provide declaration which has my name in it but it is a really big document that I just can't upload to Uber I have a green light hub appointment.

1730150008.0,Injury following wrong delivery location ,"Hello everyone!

I am posting (on behalf of my now hospitalized father) in case anyone else has experienced something similar to this or has any advice (if any). 

My severely disabled dad made an order for himself and my 2 disabled grandparents the other day. Upon delivery, despite signs on the (wrong) door and explicit delivery instructions, the food was delivered to the wrong door of the house (door is stuck shut and is now unused- not that the circumstances matter). This door is not a considerable walk (for able bodied people) and was only about another 30 feet around the house, for reference. It wasn‚Äôt up any kind of hill or uncomfortable terrain, there‚Äôs a path leading from the one door to the other.

As the food was already delivered and the order was completed, my dad ventured outside to get the food from the other door, as my grandparents are still less able bodied than my father. My dad ended up falling whilst retrieving the delivery and is now hospitalized with a broken ankle and brain bleed. 

I had him report to support the minute it happened, no compensation was provided but he wanted the driver to be aware to prevent this from happening to someone else. However, I am not okay with this. My father is now in the hospital with severe injuries because neither the delivery instructions nor the physical signs were heeded.

If anyone has any insight into whether this is truly a ‚Äúnothing can be done‚Äù situation or if others have had a different outcome. I think a refund for the order is deserved, at the very least. Delivery services are often utilized by the disabled community and my dad getting severely hurt/hospitalized because someone chose to ignore instructions is just completely unacceptable. 

Tl;dr Food delivered to the wrong place, despite explicit instructions. Disabled father hospitalized with a broken ankle and brain bleed after retrieving the food from the incorrect location.

I received an email today that said, ""*Maribel again with Uber Support. I've reviewed your interactions with our support line and do appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention. We are actively working on improving our line of business to allow our agents the ability to flex outside of our strict policies in order to understand core issues*."" She went on to acknowledge that I will be refunded fully and that my account is active/usable.  This is interesting because **A)** I didn't end up calling support, and **B)** The chats were marked as ""resolved"" so I'm not sure how/when they were forwarded to her for follow-up. Either way, I'm pleasantly surprised by the response. I expected nothing. It still should never take this long, but I'm glad it's maybe not a *complete* dead end. **\*\*UPDATE\*\***

Yesterday, my wife and I were exhausted after a long weekend out of state with the in-laws, so when we got home, we ordered two burgers and two fries from Shake Shake via UberEats at 6:09pm. The estimated delivery time was 6:35 with ""latest arrival"" at 7:00. The order kept getting delayed and ultimately arrived at 7:20pm - 40 minutes after she picked up the food (we live 9 minutes from the restaurant). The driver appeared to be running personal errands en route as they stopped for nearly 10 minutes at a store parking lot on the way (I know Uber can track this, but I took timestamped screen shots of the driver stopped in the same spot).

But the worst par was when I opened my burger to put it on the plate, a cockroach fell off of it and onto the carton. Naturally, we threw all of the food out (in the trash cans outside). I submitted a help request to UberEats within minutes of receiving the order (the order arrived at 7:20, the image is time stamped 7:21). Their response was to refund me for the price of one burger. Their reasoning was that ""in order to be fair to all eaters, they have to be consistent"" so they cannot refund the entire order. After several more exchanges, they held firm in that stance.

I knew their customer service was bad. But this is next level bad. I would have expected a partial refund if I was writing only about the fact that the food arrived 20+ minutes after the ""latest arrival"" time. That would be reasonable. But the fact that they are only willing to refund the single item means that they believe their customers should eat food that's been sitting in a bag with at least one cockroach for, presumably, the entire 40+ minutes it too for the food to get bagged at the restaurant, picked up, and then dropped off at our house.

Either that, or they assume anyone requesting food safety help is a liar. Putting foreign objects on food to get free meals is well known and longstanding tactic, so I wouldn't blame them for being skeptical about any ""there was XXXX in my food!"" complaints. They probably get a ton of them. But even then, take it on a case by case basis. We've been Uber customers for more than a decade, and have placed dozens of Uber Eats orders without major issues like this. There are far easier things to place on food than a live cockroach if the aim was to scam UberEats into giving us a free meal.

At this point, I'm less bothered about the $25 or so I'm eating (or not eating, technically) on the order than I am about the straight up dismissal by Uber's ""Support"" team. If I was at the physical restaurant and showed them a cockroach on my burger less than 2 minutes after receiving it, they'd promptly refund me and/or offer to replace the order. It's disgusting, but also pretty straightforward problem/solution. And if a health inspector found a cockroach in the restaurant's food prep area, they'd be fined and shut down until they could demonstrate that the problem had been resolved. But according to UberEats, customers should just eat everything else in the bag they didn't actually witness the bug walking on.

If anyone has advice on escalating complaints with Uber, let me know. I tried Facebook messenger and X DMs with no luck.

1730129906.0,Acceptance rate,"I am a new driver, started 2 weeks ago. 

Yesterday, i accepted a delivery in an area i generally avoid due to bad traffic. while in the area, I received the same similar requests minimum 15 times: 
pickup 3 packages at Walmart, 
price offer: 8-9$ total (incl tips), 
Expected tune: between 55 min to 70 min, 
Drop off: 3 unrelated deliveries at different addresses 
for about 12 miles (i suspect acrual would have been a bit more with the 3 stops). 

Granted, each 15 offers might have had slight variances with one of the factor: stops, price, order of stops, or mileage. Overall, it never was a credible offer.

My acceptance rate was pretty stable at 45% since I started. Yesterday, because of this laughable offer, received repeatedly with minimal updates, if any, it went down to 18-20%. 

I did receive a notification that my acceptance rate was lower than others. I am not worry about it because this offer was an ask to volunteer. But I'm little annoy to receive notification that:
A) I could not respond to, 
B) I could not challenge its accuracy,
C) was initiated by ubereats

I looked through the help resources, didn't find nothing to this scenario. I Contacted the support by chat, wrote my question to the bot, rewrote it for the agent who needed to put me on hold for 3min to look into this. I received a follow up 9min later: a cut and paste of the acceptance rate calculation from the help resources. My question was clearly worded around one request being counted as decline every time a dime was added/removed, stop order changing, or adding/removing 0.1 mile, etc. 

I don't mind receiving the same  requests multiple times, preferably if there is a noticeable effort to make it more appealing. But really? to keep receiving the same similar order 15 times, and then receiving a comment on my acceptance rate was a bit setting me up for failure...

1730121552.0,Was I out of line? ,"I'm a driver and I just got a report about unprofessionalism. Tried to think about all the deliveries I did 24 hours before the report and out of all my deliveries I only spoke to two of my costumers. 

One was short and to the point. Nothing wrong and we were both polite. The other one I was delivering a meet at door to this ladies house. I knocked and eventually someone opened the door... And by someone I mean a baby. Like he was barley two years old I swear. So I waited an awkward second to see if the mom was coming. Nope. So I asked him if his mom was home. He's obviously shell shocked because I'm a stranger and really only repeated the word ""mama"" while nodding and shaking his head. I felt weird talking to a baby trying to get him to go get his mom for me. He eventually ran off leaving the door cracked but he just started playing with another baby I saw crawling in the hallway. I knocked on the open door and still no adult so I closed the door, went to my car, and called the lady. She answered and said she was handling another kid in the back after I explained the situation telling me to just leave the food on the porch. So I did. 

Then I had to do a U-turn at the end of the road because it was a dead end and when I passed the house on my way out I saw the food still on the porch except the baby had the door wide open and is digging through the bag. I just kept driving (there was a fence and a gate so the baby couldn't run out in the road or anything dangerous like that) but I called the lady again because I was still worried. She thanked me and laughed about the situation. 

Anyways. Maybe that was too long of an explanation but whatever. It was still a funny situation I guess. That interaction is the only one I can think of that might have caused a report from the customers point of view? I mean i still have a good rating and this was my first professionalism report so I'm not worried about that. Maybe I'm just tired but I just hope I didn't make anyone uncomfortable.

1729986144.0,Food stolen? Too bad. According to UE Support.,"Currently in customer ""support"" hell because our driver who was delivering our food decided to just take a photo of his hand covering the camera and drove off with our $50 worth of Chinese food. We were told our order isn't eligible for a refund or price adjustment.

My pregnant wife was really craving Chinese food and we both got off work late. Mentally drained, exhausted and hungry, we decided to order from a place called Hunan Restaurant. The driver drove up to our place, parked for a second in our driveway and then drove off. I called this guy 6 times to see wtf was going on. No answer. He just blocked me. When my wife realized we had our food stolen, she began to cry. She was very hungry, emotional, and all she was looking forward to last night was that Chinese food, and we had the unfortunate luck of ending up with an awful driver.

There is a silver lining. I called the Restaurant and explained our terrible situation and thankfully, the restaurant said they would remake our food at no additional charge to us. When I drove over to the restaurant, the waiter there said he called Uber Eats and they explained to him that we would be getting our refund. 

Now I'm going through their customer support, and they  just regurgitate the same information over and over again. ""We can confirm this order isn't eligible for a refund or price adjustment. Thank you for your understanding."" We ""technically"" got the food we paid for. But I really wished it didn't come at the expense of my wife's emotions and having to drive to the place we wanted food delivered from.

I just want that driver to be removed so he doesn't steal food from someone else. But it seriously looks like nothing is going to happen to him. ",UberEATS,64,25,0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gcy47h/food_stolen_too_bad_according_to_ue_support/

When I contacted support, she said that for some reason it wasn't marked as picked up even though I did all of that. While she was working on it, the system auto cancelled the delivery. She then told me all she could do was give me six dollars. This means I was paid one third of my promised wage for the work, and denied my tip.

1729968716.0,Uber had me takeover for a Coco robot in Los Angeles.,"Yesterday afternoon in Los Angeles, I got an offer to pick up from a delivery robot on a residential street corner. The offer for $9 for less than half of a mile, so I accepted. 

The restaurant name on the offer was 'Pink Sidewalk Robot'. The robot was exactly where the offer said it would be. It was not an Uber robot, it was a Coco robot. The robot was stuck at a section of sidewalk that was blocked by construction, and it appeared that it was unable to continue a delivery.

The instructions on the offer said to enter the code on the robot that was sent to me via text message. Of course, there was no text message. I called Uber support and they were unable to help. Their immediate solution was for me to cancel the order. I was not about to do that.

I called the phone number on the offer for 'Pink Sidewalk Robot'. Coco Support answered. I gave them the number that was on the robot, then support opened the robot remotely. 

Inside the robot was a bag of food from Pad Thai On Beverly. I grabbed the bag, got in my car, and drove the two blocks to the delivery address. A quick $9 was easily made.

So now we are relief backup for the robots.",UberEATS,86,315,0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gcs2as/uber_had_me_takeover_for_a_coco_robot_in_los/

1729955439.0,Brain-dread Uber Eats support agents are gonna get my account deactivated ,"At least for shop and pay orders. The payment system with the plus card is garbage. 90% of the time it works, but then it just randomly won‚Äôt process the payment and I have to use my own funds and request a reimbursement. I know a lot of times it‚Äôs because the amount charged is higher than what the estimate is on the app, but sometimes the estimates are just way off especially for some restaurant order-and-pays. Some restaurants will raise their menu prices and Uber does not update it on their side. 

Anyways, I had a massive shopping order over 250 dollars the other day and I couldn‚Äôt fit the entire picture with all the items listed without zooming the phone camera back making the writing hard to see. I submitted it partially showing most the items and the subtotal as the app only lets you submit a single photo. I immediately spoke with a support agent to request a reimbursement as I had to pay with my own money. I then gave him pictures of the receipt in two parts showing all the items and subtotal. He assured me everything would be reimbursed and processed correctly blah blah blah. Over 48 hours later and a few frustrating phone calls and chats with support I finally received my reimbursement. They emailed me saying I would be banned from doing Shop and Pays if I don‚Äôt begin submitting correct itemized receipts. I emailed back explaining the situation and how I had actually submitted the receipt pictures correctly to other support agents. No response. Oh well, at least I got my money back. 

Just yesterday I do an order and pay at a restaurant. Again the payment did not go through. The estimate was for around 46 dollars but the subtotal was for around 53. I pay out of my pocket for it. The problem is the restaurant does not provide paper itemized receipts and only texted me a copy of the full receipt. On this order, the uber eats app prompts me for a picture of the receipt but does not allow me to grab pictures from my phone library, so I just submit a picture of a paper with the restaurants name and a few order details. I right away knew this was gonna be a problem. Before delivering the order I speak with a support agent where I was able to send the actual receipt. I also requested the reimbursement. I explained the situation and asked him to make sure to correct my original submission.  He assured me everything will be a O.k. replying with the typical copy and paste prompts of ‚ÄúWe are sorry for the inconvenience‚Äù ‚ÄúRest assured‚Äù blah blah blah. 

This morning I get an email saying they will only reimburse me the 46 dollars estimate amount as I did not submit an itemized receipt and that I am at risk of being banned from doing shop and pays. If I believe this is an error to please respond to this email with the correct receipt. I received the email through the Uber app, but here‚Äôs the thing, the agent that sent me that closed the email discussion so now I can‚Äôt even respond to that. 

I‚Äôve now been chatting with support agents to get my full reimbursement and to make sure they don‚Äôt demote my account. They unfortunately now have no idea what to do. They go ‚Äúit seems as though your reimbursement has already been processed‚Äù 

What a pain in the ass. Here I am paying out of my own pocket, having my funds held from me for days, risking not getting paid back in full, wasting time with countless support agents, and finally getting threatened to get demoted from shop and pays all because their entire payment system and support agents are ridiculous and incompetent. 

Even though most reimbursement requests do go smoothly, I still have many other examples of when it didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs such a hassle! Sorry for the long read.

I ordered ¬£100 of food from Uber Eats last night that never arrived. Me and my friend tried to contact support and even the delivery driver and we had no luck. But the order says it was delivered and he was able to get our code. I never gave the code to anyone. Not even my friend. So how was he able to say the food was delivered if he never received the code?
Uber Eats claim we gave him the code hence why it was considered delivered. But we didn't.

I received the receipt this morning and the food was supposedly delivered to an address in the Town over so it was no where near our address. 

Has anyone dealt with this? Uber Eats are being incredibly unhelpful and I am honestly quite angry, I've just lost ¬£100. I've disputed it with the bank.

But the manner in which it occurred, ie right in front of the house knowing that I would have to see it, I felt like they could have done it before or after I got my food and then there wouldn't have been an issue. But thank you for all the insight I do appreciate it.

So I was hoping for some insight on an incident that occurred the other night with my delivery. I opened my door to get my food and tell the driver my pin and I see the passenger in his car standing in the road in front of my house peeing a river to the point you could actually smell it. I grabbed my food and as I turn to walk back in the ""gentleman "" while still urinating at full force tries to speak to me.  On one hand I understand if you gotta go you gotta go but on the other hand I am extremely grossed out by this. I guess my question is how would you handle this situation? Should I report this?

Everything looked good during checkout, I can see the promotion being applied and even after checkout, the correct pending amount is shown in my bank app. 

After the order was completed, the total didn't have the coupon applied so I opened a chat with them hoping to resolve the issue but of course, without screenshot they won't do anything. Instead they just close the chat without even letting you explain the situation. This is the second time it happens to me. The first time I had a screenshot fortunately. I forgot to take one this time, but that's beside the point. I shouldn't even have to screenshot it. They definitely have a way to check if you had a coupon at the time the order was placed.

At this point, I don't even care about resolving the issue. Instead, I want to focus on exposing this behavior. This is so blatant and deserves more attention than it's currently getting. If you guys have any idea how to make this reach /r/all, I'm all up for it.

1729807028.0,Cancellation fees on alcohol delivery vs food,"The other day I placed an alcohol delivery order for a few cases of beer and seltzers for ~$400 and then cancelled immediately after placing the order.

I ended up getting charged the full 400ish fee which was surprising since alcohol doesn‚Äôt require any preparation and no driver was assigned to the order since it was ~30 seconds between the order and cancellation.

I talked to Uber customer support who said that because ‚Äúthe order was in preparation it cannot be stopped‚Äù which I thought applied to food but not alcohol since it‚Äôs in a case (i.e., not perishable). I contacted the store who also said they didn‚Äôt receive any money for the transaction (which means Uber kept it all) and therefore couldn‚Äôt help with a refund or fulfilling the order anyway.

If I knew this would happen, I would‚Äôve at least taken the alcohol but now am ~$400 in the hole. Is there any recourse to get some form of a refund or replacement order? Seems like a hefty fine for a situation where the store or Uber didn‚Äôt lose anything. Even a small cancellation fee would‚Äôve been fine but this is a brutal policy especially since I use Uber eats for corporate purposes quite often.

I have a clear photo of where to sit the food in the app.  Good lighting if it's dark. Clear instructions.

2. I assume leaving negative feedback for one person doesn't get sent along to whoever the next driver is. 

Also is there a reason for why people may be doing this that I'm missing? 
The patio is mesh so you can see inside. It also has numbers on the clear door so they can be certain they are at the correct address. I also leave the light behind the front door on to make it clear they are expected.

1729738844.0,"UberEats Won‚Äôt Remove a Disputed Charge After I Won‚ÄîNow They‚Äôre Demanding Payment and Refusing to Close My Account
","I won a dispute against UberEats through AMEX after they failed to deliver my order properly. It was dumplings from a very expensive restaurant and by the time the driver delivered them (60 minutes past the time he arrived to deliver them), they were inedible.

The driver was an AH and even though he was in my complex, refused to deliver my order, stopped communicating to me for 7-10 minute intervals, wouldn‚Äôt come to the drop off spot, refused to tell me where they were and told me they were ‚Äúthinking about if they were going to deliver my order or not‚Äù!!!¬†

Despite being on the phone with support as well as thru the app, during 40 minutes of this debacle, UberEats refused to even refund my $1.99 priority fee. I spent a couple of weeks arguing with them (they were truly AHs), I finally just filed a dispute with AMEX, who sided with me, in May 2023 and fully refunded me.

Flash forward, it‚Äôs now 17 months later and UberEats still refuses to accept the dispute results and continues to demand payment.

This is their response to me:

""However, it appears a chargeback initiated with American Express has put your account into arrears. Our team‚Äôs investigation of this charge leads us to believe it was legitimate and will need to be settled before you can request again. You‚Äôll either need to contact American Express to cancel the chargeback, or let us know which payment method on your account you‚Äôd like to charge the arrears to.""

I just want to close my Uber account and revoke any permissions they have, but I am in an endless loop that I cannot seem to get them to move past. Have tried using X, spoke to AMEX again, etc. I know legally they can‚Äôt charge me after losing the dispute (confirmed by AMEX), and that they themselves lost the dispute with AMEX, but they don‚Äôt seem to care what‚Äôs legal. Has anyone else dealt with anything like this? Any suggestions to get this resolved? I told them to send my account to collections if they want to, but to close it out. And still, they refused.

Edit to Add:   
Uber has violated the **Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA).**   
The merchants' terms of service do not and cannot supersede federal law or the binding resolution of the credit card chargeback process. The FCBA protects consumers from continued collection attempts after a charge has been lawfully disputed and resolved.

Their correspondence with me actually violates the FCBA, in every possible way, including continuing to request payment. It turns out that if a merchant disagrees with the dispute, legally, they can appeal it but they have to have new/additional evidence, to prove why they're appealing. All of my evidence was screenshots of our entire chat, which included my initial request to Uber to just refund my $1.99 priority fee, which I felt was a reasonable ask under the circumstances. Uber denied me. Amex made the decision to give me back the entire order amount (less the $15 fee that Amex paid as a part of my rewards). 

I filed a complaint with the **California AG**, the ¬†**Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** and **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB**). I will update when I get responses and let everyone know if I have any success.

And do you see the tip before accepting the order? I‚Äôm a good tipper (i work in the service industry) but I added extra to my tip for today because of what happened at when the driver showed up. I always watch the car on the vehicle tracking act. I don‚Äôt care
So much when it‚Äôs take out, but this was alcohol, so I had to meet the driver with my id. So I‚Äôm watching my phone. Apparently the driver was still 3 mins away.

We were inside, and I was waiting to meet the driver outside (hence watching the app) but we hadn‚Äôt heard him enter the yard, and my screen door wasn‚Äôt
Properly latched, so Dorian (the dog) saw someone outside and was able to open the unlatched door. Dorian is not an aggressive dog at all, but he is big and ten months, so crazy energy. 
The driver was amazing and understandable, said there was probably some glitch in the app that didn‚Äôt show his arrival.  Anyways I just feel horrible that he had to deal with the dog craziness, so I tipped extra afterwards. I guess I‚Äôd just like to know if you add more tip later, does the driver see the order it‚Äôs coming from? I‚Äôd like him to know it‚Äôs my way of saying I‚Äôm sorry he had to deal with that.

The system is just basic economics in a free market economy: people want cheap food, Uber wants to make as much as it can, and drivers are willing to drive for awful pay on the hopes that they will have a good night.

The only answer is for local, state, and federal law to recognize the problem as a workers rights problem and force fair wages. The system should not rely on tipping. Customers should have fair after-expense minimum wages built in to their costs. Just like in so many countries where food costs are high at restaurants, waiters are well compensated, and tipping doesn't even occur.

1729475863.0,Glitch caused food delivery issue.. will the restaurant get paid? ,"There is a TLDR at the end! 

I ordered from a local pizza place tonight for delivery, about $30 with tax before tip. No promos used but I did use an uber gift card balance. 

The driver called me after about 10 minutes asking me where I was, I stated on my porch thinking they had just gone down the wrong street, pretty common mistake. She said well where's that? The uber app is telling me to deliver the food to the restaurant I picked it up from!"" She then handed the phone to the store worker, who was kind after I told her to have the driver call Uber, I can't do anything about it but I'll call too. So we both hung up and called, ubereats chat support was extremely unhelpful and disconnected after I said four times ""it is not about the delay, the driver is unable to deliver the item entirely.  Yes the item was picked up, can you change the address or not?"" Apparently they cannot as SAPNA (actual handle)  ended the chat. 
I called the eats support number and she confirmed there was some kind of glitch on the driver's app side, as she and I both saw the correct delivery address.  I asked the phone worker to communicate that to the driver and tell them they will be compensated, she said she couldn't reach the driver and to call back if the food quality was bad if it arrived since it was picked up. I asked totally exasperated, if they cared at all about this poor driver going in circles for an hour due to their issue, or about the customer experience, or does uber only care about cold food?  She said yes, call us if your order is bad. Until then I can't help you.  So I hung up.  Driver arrived about 2 minutes after I hung up, 48 minutes after picking up the food. It was obvious the Driver is a senior trying to make ends meet, she couldnt understand how to input the pin so I assisted.  She couldn't stop apologizing and told me the man she spoke to ""forced the order through"" which is how she was able to deliver it.  I could see in her face she expected this one to be a total loss, she seemed defeated. 
So I increased the tip to match the order cost.   It soothes my guilt and hopefully will make her night just a little better.  But I do want some kind of apology from ubereats, my options seem to be to claim the food is cold/ damaged or just deal with it.  UberEats admitted this was their system, so I don't want to dispute the food as cold and have the money taken from the restaurant, nor Driver.  Will they be punished if I report the actually cold food?  

Tldr: ubereats Driver app glitched showed the pick up location restaurant as the drop off. Senior driver not terribly tech savvy spent 45 minutes to get my order to me. UberEats admitted it was their glitch to me over the phone, said they could not give a promo or anything for the issues unless I report damaged or cold food. It is cold but clearly due to UberEats. If I call and report it as such, will the restaurant still get paid or will UberEats blame them if they give me a credit or discount? If that's the case, I'll never use UberEats again.  So I appreciate anyone with insider knowledge.

1729472211.0,Just finished my 100th delivery after my first 2 weeks delivering. Some initial thoughts: ,"Some of this might be common knowledge here, but this is my first time to this sub. 

1. The app is buggy at times and has a lot of weird little quirks, some of which make driving and navigating the app outright dangerous. I am on android, and if the Uber eats app is closed out or my phone screen turned off for any reason and a trip request pops up, it does not allow me to see the trip in detail so I have to blindly select if I want to take a trip without knowing anything about the path. Also the user interface is just non intuitive in many ways, and seems to really prioritize not being able to access any information except for exactly when the app thinks you will need it (trying to find someone's address when you haven't picked the food up yet etc. you cant do that?)

2. Something thats happening a few times is someone will order fast food late night and in their order will be some dessert thing which the store is out of. On my end it does not allow me to call the customer until after I've picked up my orders, I can only text them for whatever reason. So now I have this situation where I need to decide if I cancel the whole order, or else I'll text them if they want a substitution, but of course they are never quickly responding to the text and now I'm holding up the drive thru? I don't know what to do in this spot, and I don't know what options the customer has to make things right with Uber on their end if I do just bring the incomplete order.

We respond to the call of service.

We being the food from the kitchen to your LITERAL table. 

We try our best to make sure the order is correct. 

We try our best to be hospitable.

And I'm not gonna mention the OBVIOUS driver only aspects.

Yet the only thing I hear on here is ""they know what they signed up for"" yet and still y'all have no problem paying the hell out of your waiter but give your drivers absolute grief. 

The math isn't mathing, y'all.

And I don't want to hear this bs of waiters getting paid a certain way because at least they're paid hourly.

A lot of times it can be dry afl for us. Waiters can go home at times making 200+ ON TOP of their hourly. 

It sounds like y'all really don't have any compassion for drivers risking their safety and vehicle integrity cause it's usually just the ""shut up and drive"" mentality.

1729467700.0,"Did an experiment, definitely learned!","I have only been driving for UE a few weeks, but I haven't ordered from the app itself in years. Today I wanted to see what the customer experience is like. I ordered one meal (no drink) from a place around 6.5 miles away. Spent about $20 or so. Accidentally tapped the button for a free Uber One trial, if that matters at all. ü§¶ I tipped $10 up front (I know this probably sounds like a bad one for the mileage, but it is actually pretty good compared to the tips I see in my area; plus, I thought better of it and added another $3 after delivery).

The order was accepted pretty quickly, I think. My driver did end up completing two orders, so I'm guessing that mine got stacked with a no tip offer. I was not able to see where the driver was until she got to my restaurant, but the app did tell me that she was completing another order. Delivery was good, instructions followed, and she left a nice message after leaving it on my porch.

I did see that while ordering, the default tip options are not dollar amounts like DoorDash has. They're percentages, and weird ones, like 18% and 23%. So, people who generally don't like to tip more than 20% would probably pick the 18% option instead of the 23%, although they might have chosen 20% flat if that option had been available. Strike one for Uber deliberately structuring things to screw drivers. There is a custom amount option, but it does take slightly more effort and is a dollar amount instead of a percentage, so I can kind of see how customers would just take the easy route.

I did have a special request for the restaurant, but there was nowhere to put that in my order screen. I knew the driver likely wouldn't see delivery notes until she had already left the restaurant, and I didn't want to bother her by messaging. I called the restaurant and made the request that way, and it was correct when I got the food.

Anyway, I wish I could talk to my driver, I just have a couple of questions. Did she accept another order while working on mine, or was she already on one when mine came up, and if so why? Did she feel my offer wasn't good? Or was it already stacked with a bad offer? No shade either way, I understand the game, just curious. Also, I'd really like to know if she received the full $13 tip that I sent, and what the base fare was for my order. (Or if she even could tell that if the order was stacked.) If it was stacked, did it seem likely that mine or the other was the better offer? Does she remember the order in which she was instructed to pick up and drop off? Does she remember the original offer amount from UE?

It didn't occur to me until later that I could have placed the order and then gone online and accepted it myself, so I will probably try that at another time.

This is a long shot, but if you're on this forum, I'd love to DM with you. Driver name started with A, and you delivered an order from Metro Diner in OKC with a drop off time of around 1:30 pm central time. If you're comfortable, I'd really appreciate a DM to talk about those questions.  ",UberEATS,31,18,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1g8cdyl/did_an_experiment_definitely_learned/

I send them a phone number that I use to contact Support. No luck, the number is only for drivers or restaurants. I look on the Internet, find some number, send it to the customer and bingo! They have a human and all is sorted out for them. Order cancelled, I go home.

1729221089.0,Order never delivered. UberEats not refunding!!!,"Gonna copy paste down here what I wrote to Uber.

""I ordered from Panda House at 4:37AM on October 17th, 2024. The restaurant was using their own delivery partner, so I added a $12 tip. The order was supposed to be delivered latest by 5:10AM. However, the order was never delivered.

In the course of waiting for more than 90 minutes for the order, I contacted Uber Eats 5 times and the restaurant 12 times. The restaurant, however, never answered - neither mine nor the calls made by Uber Eats executives to the restaurant. It kept going to voice mails and I left them messages. After waiting for more than 90 minutes, when I called UberEats, the last two executives informed me that they have put in the request in the system for cancellation of order on their end so that the merchant can directly do it. They repeatedly told me they will get the order canceled and I should not do it or else I will be charged the cancellation fee. They also put in the record of this in the system and made a note of it, as I was told. 

However, today morning I saw that my order was shown as completed at 9AM. This was absolutely absurd as I never got the order and I had placed the order at 4:37AM. In addition to that, I was told it would be canceled on their end. I was given inconsistent information on several ends. The app kept showing the order was in progress for several hours. 

This is absolutely unprofessional behaviour on the part of the restaurant but also Uber Eats who initially refused to help me, later provided some help but ultimately showed the order was completed without me ever receiving it. This has caused me significant distress as I had ordered food before leaving for work but the food never came and I had go through the stress of calling Uber Eats and restaurant for more than an hour. Uber Eats takes no accountability for several lines of miscommunication on their end. 

I really expect a refund for the order I never received - which was in all actuality also assured by Uber Eats in my last two calls (please listen to the call recordings and also the note made by UberEats upon my calls).""

What UberEats said

""We appreciate you for bringing this concern to us.

I‚Äôm Carl, one of the supervisors from the Uber Support team.

I understand how you may feel about this inconvenience, and I took the time to investigate this further thoroughly.

However, your payment for this order isn‚Äôt eligible for an adjustment due to the high number of similar adjustments made to your account in the past.

In case you experienced any issues with your delivery, we kindly encourage you to provide your valuable feedback by rating and leaving comments for your delivery person or the merchant through the app. Your feedback is crucial in helping us collaborate with merchants and delivery persons to improve the overall order experience.

We have processes in place to review this type of feedback so your concern hasn't gone unnoticed.

I sincerely appreciate your patience over this entire process. Please let me know if I missed anything or if you still have questions

Have a safe day ahead.""

There have been NO PAST ADJUSTMENTS! I had a similar thing happen to me with a restaurant who used their own delivery guy, where my order never reached me but it showed completed and they unwilling to refund. I let that one slide but NOT THIS TIME! 
I've called UberEats like 10 times in the last 15hours with 20+ min calls and all of them giving cookie cutter responses that since the restaurant isn't picking up calls, they cannot issue refund on their end because their system doesn't allow. Also, they try to find a supervisor to talk to, but nobody is available and they say they will call/email me back but nobody does. 
What should I do now? They are LITERALLY stealing my money and coming up with ways to make it impossible for me to reach them and resolve. I'm so fed up. ",UberEATS,60,11,0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1g68ot3/order_never_delivered_ubereats_not_refunding/

He said the third and final bag was with another driver who was just behind him and would be coming shortly. I didn't feel safe enough to question or challenge given this was not the person on my app, it was late at night, and I've never had this happen before.

The 'second driver' never appeared. I got refunded the missing items after reporting them missing, no questions asked (via the Uber app). Aside from being incredibly inconvenient (we have no dinner tonight now), I'm a bit wigged out/confused.

1729200453.0,Some really great delivery people that I've met.,"I know a lot of us have problems with bad Uber drivers and delivery people, I've had my fair share of issues over the years, but I am so grateful for the awesome ones I get every now and then, such as today. I ordered some food today to make myself feel a little better after an absolutely horrible day, but when she got here she couldn't drive into my yard due to a branch that was hanging low over the driveway to my house that would scratch her vehicle if she tried driving past it. I couldn't go outside to get the order myself because I'm disabled. She could have just canceled the order due to the issues delivering and I wouldn't have even been mad at her about it, but instead she got out and walked all the way to my house to deliver it, which is a pretty good distance. Not only that, when she got to the house and I met her I apologized for the inconvenience and mentioned how the branch probably explained why a previous delivery before her had not been brought to my house despite the delivery instructions, but I hadn't known about the branch. This kind woman went out of her way to bring me the package (it was big) and even broke off the hanging branch so that it wouldn't be in the way anymore. She went above and beyond to help me when she didn't have to and it's this kindness from delivery people, and there have been others who were just as kind, on Uber Eats that has kept me as a member despite the bad deliveries I've had in the past.

I would think this would constantly push away experienced drivers, leaving their fleet with continual new-hires.
