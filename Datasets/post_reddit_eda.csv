Customer service is a Joke!,"I saw a deal pop up on my phone that said I can get $30 off $60 of groceries from a specific store. I shopped that store and when it was time to check out online the offer wasn’t there anymore. I called customer service told them it disappeared they offered me $5 credit, then $10 credit then I wanted it escalated. 


She put me on hold for 10 minutes, then the “manager” says she won’t give any credit, doesn’t know why the previous rep offered credit bec I should have been offered nothing. She said offers are only given to certain people and expire. I asked WHEN do they expire? A day, 24 hours, 2 days, an hour? Because it had only been 20 minutes in the same day. She yelled at me and I asked for this in writing. She sent me the terms of using DoorDash and pointed to an obscure paragraph. I read it around and it says NOTHING about it expiring in a day or an hour etc. her yelled again and said pretty much too bad and be faster next time and she won’t be giving me any credit then she hung up. I got a survey right after and gave all zeros.

 I called back and lo and behold .. got the SAME “manager”. She yelled, after I asked is she the only one working? Then said too bad and hung up again. I got another surgery and gave all zeros.

$180 groceries stolen from DoorDash delivery driver.,"$180 groceries stolen from DoorDash via Walmart delivery driver. 

Ordered groceries to be delivered from Walmarts app since I am super super sick and both my kids (4 and 1 year old) have pneumonia right now. 

I got a text saying the groceries have been delivered with a picture of just a black screen. I opened the front door within 1 min and nothing was there. I went to the back, nothing. We’re in Norval and there’s not many houses at the bottom of the hill here.. I walked around to every house and nothing, no groceries anywhere. 

The app shows the driver stopping at the intersection then “delivered”. I called Walmart to let them know and they told me I have to wait 7 business days for a refund. So not only did I not have the food I ordered (baby supplies, dinner ingredients among other things) but I also did not have the money. Zero compensation was offered by Walmart for the “inconvenience” (being robbed) after speaking with a manager. They just continued to apologize and say the refund will come soon. What a scam. 

So many people are struggling for food right now. I can’t imagine if I did not have a vehicle or if that was my last $180 to spend for food for my children! Explaining this to them, they offered no solution. They didn’t care if I didnt have a way to get food to my children last night or no money to get it after it was taken from me for the next 7 business days.

Luckily I have a vehicle and it wasn’t my last dime, I went to the grocery store and got the things I needed but I CANNOT IMAGINE if this had happened to someone without the means. What an absolute disgrace this was.

I have the drivers name “Hasil” and apparently they use door dash drivers to deliver their groceries. 0/10 would never recommend or trust this service again.

But hey if you’re looking for free groceries, be a door dash driver for Walmart and they’ll just brush it off after you steal them! Huge scam.

This happened three more times before I finally called the fourth guy and asked if he could message me and let me know what was going on. I figured maybe some of our order was 86ed or something. 

As it turned out, it was much worse!

Fourth driver texts me back and tells me my order was picked up. He is the fourth guy to ask for my order. It was given to the first guy. I'm pissed! 

I check outside one more time, but I know it's fruitless. Someone took our shit. So I call the support number, which seems to be through Wendy's  and not Doordash. Nothing makes sense, at this point. I have to plead my case for a refund, hoping they don't think I'm just some jagoff trying to get a free meal. No, that would be the first driver for my order, I guess. 

Anyway, I got my refund, but I want to know if there's any real penalty to drivers who do this. We ordered again at a closer place, and gave a cash tip to the kind lady who finally gave us food, an hour and a half after our first order. I love and appreciate all dashers, you're the reason I don't go hungry when my brain is failing me. I guess I've had a hard week, and I want to know if there is any justice to this. The monetary reimbursement doesn't quite cover how annoying this is.

DoorDash DashPass Scam,"My debit card was completely empty a few weeks ago, and this lasted for several weeks. Nearly every day, DoorDash would continue to charge me 9.99 and be declined because, of course, my debit card was empty.

In order to stop the charges, I of course went through the app, the proper and usual means of cancelling any sort of subscription. To my surprise, the option to cancel the subscription was completely gone. All that remained was the other options, including the one to change my payment option

Eventually, I filled my debit card and DoorDash charged me 9.99. There was zero option to cancel my subscription, and they continued to charge me until eventually they got the 9.99. Keep in mind, I did not OWE them 9.99, they were charging me 9.99 nearly every single day in order to renew my dashpass. I called support, waited nearly 20 minutes for assistance with horrible hold music, and yet, within minutes of me entering the line with the operator I was refunded my 9.99, as if this is a constant issue for them.

I can’t imagine how this affects those who have yearly subscriptions, and I can’t imagine how many people don’t recognize this or don’t call for their refund. It doesn’t take many people to make an extremely large return off this, and how are they allowed to remove my cancel option and continue attempting to charge me?

Anyone else been getting charged twice for DashPass?,"Mainly posting just so you all can be more vigilant than I was & make sure this isn't happening to you. I looked on my bank app today and saw DD took $9.99 for the dashpass. I thought it was a bit odd because I could've sworn I they took it already at the beginning of the month. I usually only ever subscribe to anything at the beginning of the month anyways so that it's easier to track. I dug further and found that I was being charged $9.99 on the 3rd of the month and $9.99 again on the 23rd of the month for the past 3 months! I also remembered that I recently had a new debit card issued with a completely new number and even a new pin, & I had yet to add any subscriptions to the new one aside from Amazon. I haven't even used DoorDash in months. I thought maybe someone had somehow gotten my info, but when I checked on *MY* account it said DashPass currently active. I canceled immediately of course but I'm confused on how they even got the card info because 1. I never added my new card and 2. the new card isn't even showing up on my account in the app. The only thing I can think of is Apple Pay, but I've kept notifications on for every transaction & it also doesn't show up in my transaction history anyways.

Thing is, it’s still active. I guess because I’m still in that 10 day window so I’ve still been dashing.

Well I had to lock my debit card and order a new one due to fraudulent activity. After tonight’s dash I completely forgot and initiated fast pay.

They can’t cancel the fast pay initiation. They also can’t seem to understand when I explain that in a few days I won’t have access to my account.

"The DoorDash business model is a joke,,,","The business model of this company is a complete joke and at minimum borders on the line of illegal. 

All evidence suggests that all they do is screw over customers and drivers all while the corporate do nothings get bonus's year after year. The customer gets overcharged for a less than satisfactory service because they stack low pay orders with high pay to subsidize them. Then they brutally underpay their drivers who are supposed to be contractors, but in reality are employees without any of the benefits and DoorDash takes advantage of this with things like acceptance rate. An independent contractor chooses to not accept the job because it's not profitable They should not be punished for it. If a customer steals food with the hand it to me option that should not fall on the driver DoorDash should require a photo or customer verification code. The hand it to me option is only there so customers can steal food and then DoorDash can blame it on the driver and use it as an excuse to terminate their account whenever they feel like it.

So, I called the DoorDash Center to get a refund/redelivery, and I chose a redelivery. But then they gave me the wrong order again: chicken, salad, and white rice.

So I called them back and asked if I could get a refund or redelivery, but they said no. I argued with the customer service center, but the answer was still no. I called Chipotle, and they said we can't see the payment options because Doordash ordered it (which makes sense).

Paying me crickets to do your job.,"I don't have a screenshot so I'll make this short

I just verified holiday hours at a store for door dash and they paid me 1 DOLLAR TO DO THAT

1 DOLLAR

to do THEIR job.

it was a short form to see if they were going ro be open on thanksgiving..but still.

THEY should be verifying holiday hours
And at the very least pay me more than a dollar to do so.

If I ever see it again I'll screen shot.

I'm not sure anyone else has already posted this but I'm not cool with that. 

I don't mind doing customer feedback but 1 dollar is nuts..I can't even buy nuts with that.

Again, At the very LEAST, more than a 1 dollar after a 24hr period.

They have enough money to get it together.

What to doing in a weird redelivery situation.,Last night we needed pull ups delivered because I have a fractured ankle and we were out of them and i really didnt feel like driving to the store. So I ordered them plus some sprite and about 30ish mins later got a notification that it was delivered (my instructions say leave on porch/no knocking dogs will go nuts) but no picture or anything so I go out to my front porch and nothings there. I crutch to my one neighbor whos close and its not on their porch ( not the first time a dasher has delivered to them by accident) and since I couldn't really check my other neighbors porches (crutches + it was dark out and yes I had my porch light and lamp post on) my wife's 7 months pregnant and on light rest atm so she couldn't really go look so I messaged the dasher asking where it was and waiting 15-20 mins and nothing so I contacted support and they offer to redeliver so I accept and get my order.

"Open Letter to DoorDash: Unjust Deactivation, Earn by Time Exploitation, and Denied Appeal","I’m posting this open letter to DoorDash because I believe the public deserves to know what’s happening behind the scenes. Recently, my account was unjustly deactivated for “prolonging pickups and deliveries,” but this claim is false.

Here’s the truth:
1️⃣ I was never given any prior warnings about delays.
2️⃣ Delays were due to restaurant readiness—not me.
3️⃣ GPS tracking logs often placed me incorrectly, showing I wasn’t at delivery locations when I was physically there.
4️⃣ I maintained a perfect 5.0 rating from customers.

I was using Earn by Time in the days leading up to my deactivation, and many Dashers believe DoorDash is exploiting this program to accuse drivers of “milking the clock” and deactivate them unfairly.

DoorDash, I’m calling on you to:
1️⃣ Reopen my case and conduct a transparent review with clear evidence.
2️⃣ Address issues with Earn by Time and faulty GPS tracking that are leading to unjust deactivations.
3️⃣ Improve the deactivation process to allow drivers to correct issues before being deactivated.

If my account is not reactivated, I will pursue arbitration.

To the public and fellow Dashers: If you’ve experienced similar issues, I encourage you to speak out. Let’s bring attention to these unfair practices and demand accountability from DoorDash.

Miles and time driving to you for a 2 dollar tip? Please STOP ,"PLEASE someone tell me why people think it's ok to tip us DD 2 dollars and expect us to drive 8 miles (25 minutes) just to turn around to go back to the area we are scheduled to dash in. 

For an example .... I get a order and don't approve it by scores go down. But when I do approve the dash I drive 2 to 4 miles to the restaurant, wait times can be 1 to 25 minutes, then I have to drive 25 minutes to your home just to turn around and drive 25 minutes back. Since DD gives us TWO dollars per trip that equals to 4 whole dollars for over an hour of my time and gas. 

If you can't tip, please order yourself and take an hour out of your day so we don't have to work for free. 

Also, TURN ON YOUR LIGHTS AT NIGHT. if I have to drive around for an extra two or three minutes just to find your house with no numbers on it don't get mad if it accidentally goes to the wrong house. 

Tip your driver's at least min wage for the time they drive to your home and the time it takes to get back to their original location. Doesn't matter if I'm picking up a catering order or one soda. I'm still doing the same efforts with my time and gas. 

If you live 30 minutes from the restaurant you choose... Tip your driver 15 dollars. That way we can make 17 dollars for that hour it took to bring YOU your food.

Crowed Zones,"Has anyone noticed how DD doesn't compensate  for the fact that sometimes the zone you frequent, can be so over loaded by dashers who don't normally Dash in this zone. For me it's annoying because I'm so close to my zone that I can get orders in my apartment. Yet for the past 3 months, I've noticed a large influx of Dashers I've never seen before which it's a free country. Yet what makes it sometimes a struggle, seeing how my zone is always crowded, DD often sends me out of zone, and like clock work, I get the, ""Would you like to switch zones"" question?

What sucks about that, 8 miles out of my zone, is a $2.00 pay cut in minimum wage due to it being a rural area. I often decline,and sometimes depending on how deep in the zone they kicked me, I say to myself, take 20-30 mintues to get back in zone? Or just stay where your at? and Dash. Sometimes doing that works out, and other times,I can tell by what type of orders I get, when Dash is literally trying to force you to stop Dashing. 

Normally when it's busy your getting orders as soon as you drop off one. 
Can anything be done about people flooding zones they don't frequent?

Wrong for removing tip? ,"My mom sent me these pictures of their food they had door dashed from Mellow Mushrooms a few days ago. Their total was about $100 and they originally tipped $14.50. I believe it was only 7-8 miles away. My mom saw the driver get out and tuned the pizzas from upside down to facing up. So she knew this driver put the pizzas upside down. Anyway, when she looked, this is how her food came out. She isn’t all that tech savvy and had me log into her account to deal with it. But she wanted me to remove the tip completely. Driver got upset about that. I guess it’s good that even looking bad, it’ll still taste the same. DoorDash refunded her both of the pizzas. 
But come on, how do you not know the proper way to carry a pizza lol. I don’t think my parents would have been to upset if it was like pizza-hut. But Mellow Mushroom is expensive and they haven’t had it in years. So I get their frustrations.

My DoorDash Driver Harassed Me,"This happened last night and I’m still pretty shaken up. I ordered DoorDash for dinner last night and everything was normal. However, about half an hour after my food was delivered, my Dasher messaged me, saying I was pretty and asked if I had Instagram. I said no so he asked for my phone number. I said no, I don’t know you to which he replied “you will know in a few days”.  By this point, I was on the phone with customer support because there’s no option to block your Dasher yourself. The guy kept on getting creepier to the point I was really scared. DoorDash’s Community Response team tried blocking him on their end but it didn’t work for some reason. After awhile, the guy backed off after I asked him to stop texting me. Luckily, he doesn’t know exactly where I live. I live on a property with 6 apartment buildings in a rectangle shape around the property. Where he gave me my food was not near my apartment building.

Got to feed my dasher last night. ,"I ordered subway and had a customized sandwich. It seems they were out of a main ingredient so it wasn’t included. I reordered from a different restaurant so I’d still have a sub for dinner with everything I wanted on it. 

However, by the time it was out for delivery I really didn’t want this sandwich anymore. I told my dasher what I’d ordered and that he was free to keep the sandwich for his own dinner if he’d enjoy it.

Thank you to the comments for helping a new dasher earn!

Hello! I just started Doordashing and I just wanted to see if this was common or anything. 

The other night, I doordashed for 2 hours on my local University Campus, one of the orders being a double dash for a Sonic and Taco Bell. Out of those 3 orders I received, NONE OF THEM, had a customer tip. Kinda bummed and getting late, I go home to get ready for my retail job.

This morning, I'm still dashing as of typing this, but I've done 2 dashes so far and both of them had no customer tips. This is starting to confuse me. Is everyone on this city tipping $0? or is there something I'm just misunderstanding here. Mainly because I had some bills screw me over, and I love dashing, but im getting low on gas funds here.

Support told me that my ratings wouldn't be affected... then gave me a Contract Violation,"So the story goes: I was out dashing today on Earn By Time (which usually does well for me) when I picked up a McDonald's order. When I was only about 3 quarters of a mile from the customer, I hit extreme traffic. I initially thought there had been an accident but it turns out when I slowly had gotten closer, a lady in a high vis vest told me there was some sort of food pantry event going on that was blocking up the main road making traffic coming from the direction I was coming from basically unable to move. Let it be known that this was the direction that the in-app Navigation was telling me to go. Also this area is a semi-rural area so basically if I did turn around to find another way it would have taken another 20 minutes to get around to the customer from another direction so I would have been late either way. 

I contacted support while I was waiting and told them that traffic was at a stand-still, but that my ratings would not be affected for this order. So finally after about 50 minutes of slowly inching forward I got through and delivered the order which was only a shake and a pie.

I thought I was gonna be good after what support told me but I still got a CV and submitted a dispute. Extremely ridiculous that something completely out of my control can get me a CV but here we are. Got a fat 20 dollars though from EBT though from sitting for so long though so I guess I'll take that.

I'm still relatively new to dashing (only 1 month, ~200 orders) so if I should have done something different let me know.

I wasn’t hired and I don’t know why. Can I get them to change their decision?,"About 1.5 months ago I was driving home from a concert going about 38 over the speed limit and got a ticket. First and only moving violation at all. I have the opportunity to either pay the ticket or show up in court to dispute it, but the court is 4 hours away so I pay the ticket and move on. 

Cut to now, I try to apply for DoorDash and they say they are pending my application. I was super scared that they’d say no, especially since I wanted a job that was easy, that paid decent and I could choose when I work and DoorDash was just what I was looking for. However, many others on Reddit and other sites said they had speeding tickets before and were still hired, especially if it was only a single one. Some of them even had DUIs at one point and still got hired. After that I had hope. Then I got an email saying I was not hired and my account would remain deactivated, and I’m really upset because that was the best looking part time job opportunity I had going for me.

3 questions: 

1. Why wasn’t I hired when so many others were despite the same thing?

2. Will taking courses to remove the points from my license or waiting 2 years for the ticket to move off my record change their minds?

3.

I would’ve tipped differently had I known. Luckily I have cash and was able to give them an additional tip.

Did this Dasher have a strategy?,"I just had an order take over an hour to get to me. It seemed like the Dasher waited at the restaurant a long time, and the delivery time kept being pushed back. Eventually the driver left the restaurant and made it to my apartment. It seemed like they parked but never moved from the car, unless they left their phone in the car. They then drive away without marking it as delivered or communicating with me at all. I wait a few minutes to see if they forgot, and I run downstairs to see if my meal was delivered. I don’t see it anywhere, and I even walk down the block to see if it was accidentally delivered to the wrong building. I don’t find it, so I contact the driver who is now quite far away and driving in what seems really strange ways. They don’t respond for several minutes, and since they won’t mark it as delivered, I can’t claim it as not delivered. I contact support, they try calling the dasher who doesn’t answer, and they cancel the order, give me a refund, and extra credits which is awesome. But I am starving and now the restaurant is closed and anywhere else that appeals to me is also closed.

I am happy with the result from DoorDash, but I am just wondering why the driver would behave this way? Why not mark the order as delivered and why not respond to me? Maybe they delivered it to the wrong building and I could have a conversation with them to figure out where exactly so I can run and grab it. Perhaps I am being too pessimistic but not marking it as delivered and not responding to me nor the agent seems really suspicious. Is there something dashers could get in trouble for that they try to avoid by not marking it delivered? Because my ability to get a refund was made more annoying by having to contact an agent and wait for them to do their part whereas being able to use the help feature with a built in “I did not receive my order” process that is quicker.

Need help figuring what to tip,"So after reading a few posts on here, I think maybe I am calculating my tip incorrectly when I order on DD. I usually tip between 20-25% of the cost of the order before taxes and fees, with a minimum of $4.50. I don’t usually order from restaurants more than 5 miles away, but do occasionally order from as far away as 10 miles.  So for a $30 order from 5 miles away, I would tip $6.00-7.00. I also factor in the time of day because if I order during a busier time, I assume there will be more competition for drivers, so I might increase my tip slightly in order to entice a driver to accept it. 

But some commenters are saying I should calculate the tip based on the mileage the driver has to drive. I live in a populated area with restaurants all around, so I don’t think a driver would have to drop my order and then drive 5 miles back to get another order. So for a $30 food order from 5 miles away, what do drivers recommend for the tip amount?

I had my order stolen by the dasher for the first time in years ,"I’m so mad right now. I have used DoorDash for 4+ years and have spent thousands on dollars (not proud of it). Tonight was the first time I ever had my food stolen. I received the delivery confirmation alert and saw the photo that proved my food was at the door. I went downstairs, turned off the porch light, put some dishes away and refilled my water bottle. This only took a few minutes. By the to me I’m ready to head back upstairs I see that the dashers headlights are still shining on the house. I thought “hmm that’s weird why would they still be here”. Opened the door and the food was no longer at the door. 

I’ve never had this happen before so I was confused. I looked around outside to see if it got blown away (🙄) or something and sure enough nothing. Their car was driving away when I opened the door. 

I’ve had issues before with orders but usually they have been parts were forgotten by the restaurant or the wrong food delivered and customer support has always given be a refund for the items that weren’t delivered, ect. Now this doesn’t happen often. It’s been almost 5 years so I feel like having mistakes happen every so often isn’t a big deal? 

However when I submitted my request for a refund it was immediately declined since the Dasher had proof of delivery of the food at the door. And no I don’t live in a building or neighborhood where people could just walk by and pick up the food. I messaged the dasher to ask her if she stole my food, she never responded. I was able to submit another request in which I was able to provide a summary of what happened. It was declined a few minutes later. I decided to call the customer service number because this was a bunch of crap. The guy didn’t speak great English so that made it hard to understand him but I explained the situation and he just said since it was reviewed twice and rejected nothing could be done.

This happens every time too, it's not just an isolated thing. It's like every time the area I'm doing GREAT in lights up and becomes a hotspot zone, the offers stop coming in and sit there for more than half an hour, only to then start getting no-tip shit offers.

The most insane doordash story I've ever heard,"My sister is 19 and just moved to Chattanooga, TN for college. She and I used to doordash around together for some extra cash, so since she hasn't found a job yet, she and her best friend decided to start dashing from time to time. In the beginning of October, they were delivering around 9:00 PM (i believe), and got an order for a hotel. They picked up the order like normal, went to the hotel, and when they arrived they decided to go inside together. The customer wanted the order delivered to their room, so they go to find the room and noticed that the door was cracked open, which was immediately suspicious to them. My sister's friend decided to stand down the hallway around the corner because she was nervous, so my sister quietly walks up to the door to avoid the customer hearing her approach, and the door opens as she approaches. They were definitely watching and waiting. This is where it gets actually crazy, the man behind the door was fully nude and wearing a balaclava or ski mask. My sister was understandably very shocked and frightened, hands off the order, and she and her friend book it out of there. As they are leaving, the man hollers after her to come back, not to leave and that he has a question, in just an eerily friendly tone considering the circumstance. I am aware that some people are aroused by exposing themselves to others, but this feels a little more purposeful and eerie to me. The cracked door, the ski mask, the calmly yelling after her to come back? I just can not imagine what could have happened if one of them decided to complete the delivery alone. I'm so thankful that she was being extra vigilant and was able to get out of there with only emotional trauma. Please please share any similar experiences you've had, this really makes me sick.

Why do I say this?? 

I work at a restaurant bakery. We sell a lot of bakery items made in house, so sometimes..we don't have them. So sometimes dashers have to try and contact the person who ordered(to see if they want a refund on that item or to replace it) and they just..don't respond. And it's usually something small like a muffin, or a slice of pie. (But there's been a couple times we didn't have peoples whole orders, because it was busy and we sold all of our bakery, or the manager/baker didn't bother to make any that night) And the dashers are sitting up there waiting, confusing guests, and just wasting both of our times. This isn't to shame anyone, or make anyone feel bad! I've been perpetrator of this crime too, and I understand why someone would do it. You just sorta forget about it when doing something else.

And also please always try have it decided whether or not you want to substitute or not if a place doesn't have an item, I've been on the phone with people for a while as well because they don't know what they want.

DD driver dropped off my order with ranch exploded inside and dripping out of the bag ,"Ordered Wing Stop with 2 ranches (paid extra for the 2nd one) and it arrived exploded all over my food container and dripping out of the bag. I messaged the guy and let him know that it was soggy when I picked it up off my porch and didn't hear anything back (which I kind of figured I wouldn't because it's probably busy). I let doordash know that it was a packaging issue as I don't think it was necessarily the driver's fault. They gave me roughly a $10 refund (I paid $25 including his tip). 

Its hard to believe he didn't notice because the bag was extremely soggy and tearing on the side you would have to put your hand under to carry the bag. I don't believe he deserves five stars because  even though it might not be his fault the ranch exploded, it was negligence on his end to not address it before delivery.

"Dear Drivers,","I appreciate what you do, which is why I’m considered an “elite” customer and pay for the annual pass every year.

Do people just not have drinks at home anymore?,"Like seriously, why do so many people have to order drinks? Do people just not have drinks at home? I have like a 2-liter of soda and a 24-pack of canned soda in my fridge. And it's always the low-tipping people that of course has to have drinks included. When ordering, I wish people would take into consideration there's only so much that we can carry. And believe it or not, some places don't have drink carriers for some reason.

Accepted an offer this evening, didn't really pay attention to the details of the order, I knew a drink was included but didn't see how many. Went to go pick up the order and it was 2 bags of food and 4 drinks, and the restaurant had no drink carriers. Like, WTF am I supposed to do? Balance some of the drinks on my head? I only have 2 hands, and they have 2 big bags of food and 4 drinks with no drink carriers they expect me to carry. Not to mention I only have 2 cup holders in my car so what am I to do while driving? Hold the other two in my hands and use my knees to drive?

Once I saw that I told the store employee that without a drink carrier, I have absolutely no way to carry all of that and that my car doesn't even have enough cup holders for that many drinks and just unassigned myself from it and left.

People need to keep in mind that we can only carry and hold so much when they place an order.

Confused with refunding and credit.,"November 16th, Saturday, I had ordered a door-dash order of $23.33. I waited an hour and there was no one to pick it up, door-dash even sent a notification that said there are no dashers and i could pick up my order instead. I couldn’t pick up my order (hence why i door-dashed) so I wanted to cancel and get a refund. When I went to cancel my order it said i would only get refunded $8 (and some change) and that didnt work for me, so i called customer service and they cancelled it for me. I asked very explicitly if i would get a full refund to my card (a refund of 23.33) and the man on the line said i would, he repeated the amount i would get refunded and said it would go to my card. 

Fast forward to earlier today, I see i have door-dash credits of $8 (and some change), and i was confused because no one mentioned anything about credits. I wanted to make sure my full refund would go to my card like I was told, and I wanted to see if this credit was just complimentary, so I called again and turns out this credit is part of my refund, and only $15 dollars would be going to my card. So i told customer support that I was told i would get a full refund to my CARD, and i made sure I said my card. The lady told me she was able to transfer my full refund to my card, so I felt pretty good. 

Now fast-fast forward to now, I just checked door-dash and see that my credit raised from $8 to $15. Can someone explain?? Will I still get my full refund?

Drivers: please STOP driving in the WRONG WAY gates at those neighborhoods. ,"I understand that you don't have a code and you are pressed for time to make your delivery. But these gates are marked WRONG WAY for a reason. You will be driving into the direction of oncoming traffic. Residents including drivers AND pedestrians are not expecting you to enter that side. If you hit someone's else's vehicle or God forbid you run down a pedestrian - not only will you not be doing delivery anymore (wrecked your car and removed from the delivery platform), but your life will now be filled with Court Appearances, fines, police investigations, and more. It is not worth it. No job pays you enough to take the risk of colliding into a pedestrian. And when the police arrive, they will ask you how the accident happened and why you were on the WRONG WAY side. Stating ""I didn't have a code"" is not an excuse to break the law.

Just Started And I Want To Learn Quick,"Hi, I just started dashing for the first time and made 11 bucks in 56 mins. My goal is to make 30 bucks a day combined with my full time job at safeway, 30 a day a week equals about 210 dollars a week which is 800 into savings plus the 200 a week I put away from working at safeway is 1600 in savings a month. I'm doing this to pay off my car loan by my birthday. Any tips on which orders to accept, youtube channels to watch and if I should buy the thermal bags to put the food and drinks in. Any help is appreciated, thanks.

Update
 
I did 3 shifts, one 12:30 to 1:30 and made 11 bucks, 2nd shift I did 2:30 to 3:30 and made 14.50, then 3rd shift 4:30 to 5:30 and made 9:50. I totaled 35 bucks.

The real explanation behind why non tippers get #%^* service,"I see so many posts complaining about the poor service they got from their DoorDasher, and I *think* I can explain it a little more in depth. 

A platinum level dasher has FIRST priority over high paying deliveries, so the people who are tipping adequately are going to get picked up by a platinum dasher. This means the dasher has paid their dues grinding out 100+ garbage orders already, they’ve learned how to be friendly and time efficient, they probably have a stockpile of straws and sauces from various restaurants in their car in case you ask for more sauce after they already left the restaurant, they either use the cheap free insulated bags that DD provided them- or they have been doing it long enough and actually spent their OWN money on nicer insulated bags, they may even put the seat warmer on in their car to ensure your food stays as hot as humanly possible on the ride to you. Why? Because a platinum dasher wants to keep their platinum level. We get less bs low paying orders, we need to keep above a 4.7 rating and 95% completion rate. These dashers aren’t going to risk their benefits to screw you over out of pettiness. 

The new dashers are the ones given these no to low paying deliveries, cuz it’ll be given to them first & if they accept it and it goes back into circulation- a platinum dasher absolutely will not accept your order, and it will be pushed back down to another new dasher, or even force the original one that declined it to accept it(happened to me when I was still new, I’d decline an order and it’d come back around 3 mins later and literally make me accept it against my will)
These dashers don’t have rapport with DD yet, they haven’t done that many dashes yet, they’re still figuring out the system and the do’s and don’ts of dashing, and deciding if they even like doing it or not. This is why if you don’t tip, a new dasher, or a dasher who doesn’t qualify for platinum status because of bad reviews or too low of a completion rate(means they prob have stolen some orders or quit in the middle of a dash) will be the one assigned your order, and your chances of getting a less than favorable delivery are wayyy higher than if you tipped and got it picked up by a platinum dasher who is thirsty for 5* reviews and providing quality service.

Doordash Adjustment ,"Wondering how I can get a higher adjustment. A lot of drivers say take your time. I thought it was the opposite because a few weeks ago my active time was 16 hours, dash time was 62 hours, and adjustment was $287 

The next few weeks, the dash time is always higher still, but not by 50 hours like this one. Maybe by 10 hours, and I haven't got an adjustment because I make more than the minimum 

So I'm assuming the dash time needs to be significantly higher than active time right?

This week l started being more selective and stopped taking shit paying deliveries. Best week I’ve had. And less stressful. Thanks guys. You showed me the way. ,"I started dashing almost a month ago as a second job. I’ve been going through a horrible divorce and every dime of my money has been going to my lawyer. I started out with Uber Eats first, and that was a complete joke. My girlfriend told me she used to have luck with DoorDash so I gave that a shot recently. 

At first, I was taking every delivery that was coming my way because I didn’t want to affect my acceptance rating and I wanted the platinum status. While I do like being able to start dashing at any time, it feels really good to turn down those ridiculous deliveries that don’t pay enough to even cover expenses.

 I recently hit around 200 deliveries. And have been reading everything you guys have been posting about it not being worth taking everything that comes your way. And you are 100% correct. I’ve been traveling less miles and making more money. I just wanna say Thank You to you guys for your posts and showing me the way.

In store I can substitute with water, but on the app, selecting a drink is mandatory to continue and water isn’t listed. Would this be a DoorDash not allowing substitutions, or a restaurant issue not listing water as available?

Previous incorrect delivery pictures on my dashers app?,"Okay I've doordashed for years right?

Stacked Orders,"I am so sick of Door Dash stacking orders. I assume that's what the term is for what happens to my orders. I order something, it gets picked up immediately, and then the driver goes in a completely different direction, waits for a second order, makes a dropoff, then gets to me like 20 minutes later.

From what I've read, DoorDash does this to stack up orders of non-tippers with tippers, to give an incentive to grab both. I tip pretty well and my food almost always gets picked up very quickly. If a driver is \*really\* fast, I sometimes add a few extra bucks. Easy orders -- a house with no complicated instructions, etc. 

The drivers say that the tip is less option and more of a 'bid' for them to take the work. And I'm actually fine with that. It makes sense. The problem I have is, the tip is not always commensurate with service. Why should I tip more if DoorDash just sends a driver on a second order before mine?

I have had great drivers deliver my food quickly. Tonight, this guy has had my food in the back of his car for 20 minutes. Probably not even his fault. It's ridiculous. Assuming I'm interpreting it correctly, DoorDash needs to stop with this stacked order garbage.

Why are drivers so bad at finding addresses?,"I was lazy today and ordered DoorDash twice, once for breakfast and another for dinner. This morning my dasher (who has delivered to me 4+ times before) parked across the street from me. I figured she would see me and just walk over but alas she did not. Instead she calls me and proceeds to repeat over and over again that she does not speak English only Spanish. So I then proceeded to wave my arms around like the wacky wavy inflatable arm guy for several minutes until she looked over and saw me. Then she sends her what looked to be 10 year old kid over to bring me my food never actually getting out of the car herself. 

Then for dinner I tried ordering again and again got another dasher who has delivered to me multiple times. He proceeds to park across the street from my building as well about a half block up from where I'm at. Then he calls me to tell me he's there and I explain I'm actually across the street several houses back. I'm also again already waiting out on my front stoop in anticipation of my delivery so I wave at him thinking surely he sees me. He says he does, great he'll be there in a second. Wrong. Apparently he saw people sitting on another stoop in the complete opposite direction and starts heading there while I'm trying to shout at him from across the busy main street. He did not hear me so I had to call him back and explain that he went the wrong way until finally he realizes his mistake and heads over. He even comments as he's walking up to me oh I should have remembered I've delivered to you a bunch in the past. 

So I just wanna throw this out there for any DoorDash drivers reading this. In America many cities will number housing on certain sides of the street with all odd numbers or all even numbers. Please familiarize yourselves with this so when you see a delivery to 1234 Main Street you know which side of the road to deliver on.

Is poor service just the risk we have to take?,"I tip well, and the reason I tip well is because I have instructions that, while simple, I understand is an inconvenience just for asking for any kind of different treatment. All I ask is that the food be dropped off in front of the garage door & not the front door, because the Ring doorbell scares my dog when it's activated, and I don't like when he's scared. The garage is approx. 5 feet to the right of the front door, and protrudes out in such a way that you actually have to walk past it to get to the front door.

Customer gave me an additional cash tip that left me in shock,"  Around the time of this dash, I was really hoping to make a certain amount so I could cover rent/utilities.

Plus, I only had to grab 2 bottles of wine, so it was quick and easy! 
When I arrived at the customer’s house, he was waiting outside for me. I scanned his ID, and he said something along the lines of, “I saw that I made you drive pretty far, I’m so sorry about that!” Then proceeded to hand me a $100 bill. I was in total shock- I started shaking and could only get out, “Oh my god, are you sure?” He smiled and insisted, so I left that order with a $110 tip.

I’m taking your platinum orders,"I was a platinum dasher for 6 months. I made less than ever and was under the impression it was because of more drivers than customers. Customers tipping less. Nope. Platinum is designed to trick you into taking as many orders as possible. You think you’re being prioritized but I can assure you, you’re not.

When platinum my ratio of a $2.50/mile order was about 1:13, literally awful.

I’m in Austin Texas and it’s busy as hell here.

I realized while I was doing no tip or less than $1/mile orders everyone who was available, platinum or not was getting the good $2.50/mile orders.

Detailed Delivery Instructions and still delivered to wrong house,"Hey Door dash community,

I placed an order last night and it got sent to my neighbors (who I'm not cordial with and wouldn't trust with my food at all). It isn't the first time this has happened but the first time the dasher told me the location ping was at their address. I checked and it didn't appear to be but I edited it to be sure. 

Ive also seen people suggesting you should include in the delivery notes detailed instructions in case the ping is wrong. Since then I've always left very specific instructions to avoid confusion (ex: please leave on the green chair, we have a no soliciting sign in the window).

Yesterday I ordered and the picture showed the driver left it at my neighbors on the floor outside their door. Someone brought my food back and rang the bell (also in my delivery instructions not to do since we have a loud dog). I'm suspecting it was someone staying at my neighbors (I think they're away) and fortunately the food was still sealed so I don't believe it was tampered with. I'm just frustrated because I'm not sure why I'm tipping a driver beforehand for them to still not follow clearcut instructions.

 I know doordash is cut throat and people don't make a lot of money. I feel bad filing a complaint and maybe getting the delivery driver in trouble. I have no proof they corrected their mistake because the picture shows it at the wrong address - and that is also their proof they correctly delivered, which obviously they didn't. DD hasn't prompted me to rate the delivery which I find odd but I'm not well versed in doordash and it's workings. 

I'm just conflicted because I don't think I should be paying for a wrong delivery when I've done everything to make it clear where I'm located. Just wondering what delivery drivers think about this as you have insight into the other side. Could it be this is just a doordash bug or was the driver just neglectful? I just don't want to be unfair to the delivery driver if this wasn't explicitly their fault.

DoorDash Deactivated me. ,"**UPDATE:** I should have clarified this earlier—my stats plummeted after I moved to a city I won't name in North Florida from Orlando. In Orlando, I had a 95% acceptance rate, 100% completion rate, 99% on-time rate, and a perfect 5.0 customer rating. I was thriving there. But since moving, my experience has been terrible, and so are my stats.

The traffic here is a nightmare. Every day, I either witness an accident or a close call. This city consistently ranks in the top 15 for worst drivers in the US—with a little research, you'll figure out which city I'm in. Food is almost always late, making multi-apping a risky move. Drivers are either painfully slow or dangerously aggressive. In one week alone, I've nearly been hit three times by people blowing through stop signs. GPS here is useless; I'm constantly having to call customers for directions. It’s one thing for GPS to be off occasionally, but here it regularly drops me in the middle of nowhere.

I've been dinged with low ratings for things beyond my control. A leaky cup holder (I ended up buying my own off Amazon), a duplex with the same unit number and street name as the one two blocks over. Why would you have two identical addresses within a 3-block radius? 

Once I arrived at an address with three identical food orders already sitting outside, making mine #4. After leaving, I get a call from the customer saying she never got the order. After a bit of research, I realize that all the food I saw was from her constantly having to reorder her food because her address doesn't show up correct in the GPS because there's a house with the exact address as her duplex a block away! 

And don't even get me started on trying to deliver to trailer parks in the middle of the night when you can't even see the address/unit on the trailer. It's been a nightmare.

So yeah, judge me all you want. I'll take it. But this low-stat performance is a recent phenomenon. A month ago, I drove back to Orlando and my stats improved in just those two days, so I'm not just imagining things.

Anyway, I'll take the L. DD has been a real pain here, and honestly, I'm over it now. My instacart stats are fantastic, and I'll just have to drive back to orlando to work and get my UberEats stats back up. I'm planning on moving out of this crappy city as soon as I get my finances back in order. 

**ORIGINAL POST:** I worked for DoorDash for over a year, consistently going above and beyond for customers. At the time of my deactivation, my acceptance rate was around 45%, customer rating 4.7, and completion rate was 93% with 2 contract violations—one which was removed after a dispute.

DoorDash has been a stressful gig. Most zones near me don't pay well. The only zone that does requires scheduling a week in advance, which needs to be done between 12am and 4am, as they fill up fast due to market oversaturation.

The app is glitchy. It often freezes, kicking me out of my scheduled shift. If I pause for a few minutes, it sometimes ends my shift early, and driving out of my zone for 10+ minutes can do the same.

I was deactivated for late deliveries. I’ve stayed late at restaurants to ensure customers get their orders, even when previous drivers failed to deliver. DoorDash staff told me this was okay, but it seems to have impacted my Completed on Time rating, which was around 75%. If there was a threshold for this metric, I would have appreciated knowing, so I could have avoided waiting and declined those orders.

I requested an appeal, but it was denied without explanation. I’m frustrated because I had shifts lined up this weekend that I now can’t work.

I used to dismiss complaints about DoorDash on Reddit, thinking people weren't being honest about their performance. Now, I get it. DoorDash demanded more from me than I ever did from them. I worked hard because they paid better than UberEats locally, despite fewer orders. Now, I’m forced back to UberEats, where the rates are terrible—like $3 for 15 miles.

I chose gig work to escape the usual workplace issues. The appeal was the control over hours and earnings, even if the pay wasn't great. Now, right before the holidays when I need money most, I can’t work. DoorDash turned out worse than any brick-and-mortar job—there’s no HR or warning, just a sudden deactivation that leaves you unemployed.

My advice: take the complaints on Reddit seriously and protect your job. Ultimately, the best job is one you control. I’m making changes to ensure I’m never this dependent on a company like DoorDash again.

“Hard Break Detected” — While On Foot,"This will pertain to those of you who use that aspect of the app that monitors your driving. It was not working right for me for sometime and telling me. I was hard break when I was clearly not hard breaking. I would already be stopped and pause at a light for sometime, then I would take my foot off the break and gradually apply it again just to get inch up a little closer to the next card in front of me and I would still get “hard break detected”.
I was outside a restaurant parked, in my car when I got another order for that restaurant. I ran up to the door and stopped to open the door. The app then told me I was hard breaking.  
I ended up calling customer service and they sent me to a special group that takes information on app issues.

Best dash night EVER,"for context me and my mom have been dashing together to get some extra money for some trips we've had planned for a while. Today we were doing our normal $3-$7 orders (which suck I know) and we got a $2 papa john's order but we decided to take it because usually those mean cash tip. We get to papa john's and it was a 45 minute wait because the customer specifically requested for the order to be delivered at 6:15, which was fine because we had to use the bathroom and they don't have a bathroom there so we left and came back. We picked up the pizzas and headed there and once we got there they asked us to go up on stage, while we were up there the preacher started his sermon and had us talk about why we are doing doordash and just general life questions. After it was all over he asked what was the biggest tip we've ever gotten, we responded by saying ""$50 because it was a catering order"" and he told us that he would guarantee to surpass that. He then set a jar down and asked people to come up and if they'd like they could tip us. We started crying and they prayed over us. In the end we finished with $1,429 from a $2 order.

Did my dasher have an order from a different app?,First time this happened to me.  Dasher picks up my order. It’s an 8 minute drive to my house. About 3 minutes after pickup I get a text saying he made a wrong turn and it would take an extra 10 min. I looked at the tracking and the ‘wrong turn’ had to have been deliberate. You either go straight or you take the exit the highway and they took the exit. It’s really difficult to screw up this particular route when there is literally a map. There are like 3 turns total. I’ll accept a dumb mistake. But then instead of them taking the next exit and circling back I see them in the parking lot of a Wendy’s/Timmies before finally taking a slow road to go to me. 20 minutes after text food arrives. I gave 3 stars but could not add a note. I think I just got double apped or whatever it’s called when they use multiple apps. Should I have given fewer stars ?

Checking Food ,"Question for those who order from DoorDash. 

When you put in the notes that you want us to make sure that everything is there, do you mean that you actually want us to tear the stickers/seals and look through the bag? 

I have only had this instruction a couple times but I have never been sure what to do. I could always ask the workers if everything is there but I feel like 9/10 they are probably going to say yes no matter what.

I'm so confused about tipping...,"It used to be possible to tip upon placing the order, or upon delivery. Then it was changed to ""you can't tip before delivery"". So I'd just have to tip in the app right after seeing the delivery person or pay in the app after grabbing my food if I opted for contactless non-interaction.

Last year I had an issue where I couldn't tip at all even after delivery, so I did a live-chat and the support person applied the tip for me. They asked, and I sad ""please apply a $5 tip to this order for the dasher"" (in not so many words).

Okay, so you can't tip while waiting for the order or before pick-up and delivery. Fine, it's not really logical to tip until after I receive my food. Last night I place a double-dash order so in this case I definitely want to tip properly. As the man was approaching my door, I try to give a tip in the app and it doesn't work. I get some error message. 

So luckily, just in the nick of time I give the man a $5 bill.... that's something, but it's not enough for shuffling to 7-11 while also delivering my Chinese food. So I try again in the app, I try to tip both orders... both give an error. The next step, reach out to support.

I start a live-chat with a chat-bot which eventually gets me a human keyboard operator. Must be a keyboard operator because all they did was read me the policy about how you can't tip before the dasher pics-up or delivers the food. It's as if they didn't really read my issue. So, I reiterate... and hten the person tells me **""it's too late to tip because you can't tip after the order is completed""**.



I'm so confused. **Can't tip before but can't tip after, either?** I'm sure I'm just missing something obvious, but this is feeling a bit unnecessary complicated for me as someone who just wants to no screw over any person who delivers food to my door. Can anyone please help me understand this before I reach out to support for a third time (which precedes a formal complaint, which sux bc that doesn't get a fair tip to the dasher).",,,doordash,3,1,1.0,djronnieg,n,1,1,,,im confused tip,use possible tip upon place order upon delivery change cant tip delivery id tip app right see delivery person pay app grab food opt contactless noninteraction last year issue couldnt tip even delivery livechat support person apply tip ask sad please apply tip order dasher many word okay cant tip wait order pickup delivery fine really logical tip receive food last night place doubledash order case definitely want tip properly man approach door try give tip app doesnt work get error message luckily nick time give man bill thats something enough shuffle also deliver chinese food try app try tip order give error next step reach support start livechat chatbot eventually get human keyboard operator must keyboard operator read policy cant tip dasher picsup deliver food didnt really read issue reiterate hten person tell late tip cant tip order complete im confused cant tip cant tip either im sure im miss something obvious feel bit unnecessary complicate someone want screw person deliver food door anyone please help understand reach support third time precede formal complaint sux bc doesnt get fair tip dasher,0,0,im confused tip use possible tip upon place order upon delivery change cant tip delivery id tip app right see delivery person pay app grab food opt contactless noninteraction last year issue couldnt tip even delivery livechat support person apply tip ask sad please apply tip order dasher many word okay cant tip wait order pickup delivery fine really logical tip receive food last night place doubledash order case definitely want tip properly man approach door try give tip app doesnt work get error message luckily nick time give man bill thats something enough shuffle also deliver chinese food try app try tip order give error next step reach support start livechat chatbot eventually get human keyboard operator must keyboard operator read policy cant tip dasher picsup deliver food didnt really read issue reiterate hten person tell late tip cant tip order complete im confused cant tip cant tip either im sure im miss something obvious feel bit unnecessary complicate someone want screw person deliver food door anyone please help understand reach support third time precede formal complaint sux bc doesnt get fair tip dasher,3,182,"{'neg': 0.535, 'neu': 0.465, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182}","{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.747, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9456}",0.0,0.535,0.465,-0.3182,0.175,0.078,0.747,0.9456,0

How to consider appropriate/fair tip for Delivery App Drivers.,"This is a guide that just helps people consider a fair tip for their order so you are likely to get quick and efficient delivery.

1. The most important aspect of calculating a tip for Doordash, should mostly be based on distance and time the driver will have to go. So if you are ordering from a Restaurant 5 miles away and it normally takes 10-15 minutes to drive there, the tip should reflect that. Consider the driver needs to wait on the order. A minimum tip in this scenario should be $5(all of this is based on assumption that the delivery is done correctly and all instructions are followed aka a good job).

2. Order size should only be factored into your tip if the order is heavy or larger than normal. A 15+ item shopping order is absolutely something you should be factoring into your tip. Time is $.. ordering 1 tiny thing from CVS should not change anything when it comes to tipping based on time and distance. 

3. Time of day and traffic need to be factored into your tip. If you live in a densely populated area, that is prone to traffic and has parking difficulties, and your order during Rush Hour, please consider the extra time and effort the driver will need to exert for a delivery like this.


These 3 things are the main considerations to take into account if you care about tipping fairly and appropriately. This is not a thread to argue about tipping or exact amounts. It is just a basic guide to help regular people understand how Doordash drivers can be fairly tipped and what to consider when tipping. That is all. I feel like many people do not understand how to tip app drivers, and many customers have asked me about this, so I thought a simple guide could be helpful.

"Okay, I think I need technical help","I commented on someone else's post earlier today, which ended up becoming a big long back & forth with several other people. In a nutshell, it's sounds like either my app is glitched, or else I am simply not understanding the rating system. So here goes ...

My total number of customer ratings suddenly dive bombed this week. I have approx. 750 lifetime deliveries, and as of last week I had 99 customer ratings. (I don't recall the exact breakdown, but it was like 98 were 5-star and 1 was 4-star. Something like that.) Meaning, my average overall rating was like 4.98 or something. Suddenly, at the start of this current week, my total number of customer ratings is only 10, and my average has gone up to 5.0

After speaking with a few other dashers here on this subreddit, I got the impression that my app might be glitched. So I chatted with 3 different support agents tonight after my dashing was done, but they all told me the exact same thing: 1) If I think my app is glitched, do this list of troubleshooting steps. [Your basic clear cache, uninstall and reinstall the app, etc.] Well I did the entire list of things like 3x and it didn't help. Which brings us to 2) All 3 of the agents I spoke with told me that customer ratings ""roll over"" after each 100 deliveries. I talked around and around and around with all of them, explaining that I wasn't talking about the AVERAGE, what I was talking about is the BREAKDOWN, or the individual total ratings. But they would just repeat the same thing, that it refreshes after every 100 deliveries and the ratings restart at zero.

By the time I was done with the 3rd support agent, I was thoroughly confused. So that's why I'm turning to my fellow dashers... can you please help me understand?

(The screenshots are of just one conversation I had with support, but all my conversations basically went the same way. I'm pretty sure they were talking about AVERAGE rating, and they were not understanding that I was asking about the BREAKDOWN.)

A couple of newbie tips,"Hey yall,

background: dd for 1 year on/off; 400+ deliveries

southeast usa, big city

* your acceptance rate matters; they look at it to see how well you are dependable. They may not say it, but they are watching and will give you better deals and orders ""invisible hand"" 
* As a 1099, part time, just do the taxes on turbo tax and take standard deduction. I dont track all that bullshit.
* Use the doordash debit card and keep all expenses on that, for work, lunches/dinners on shift, etc. Even groceries. 
* Work peak hours AMAP, its worth it then. I made like 65-70 in 3 hours last saturday 07:30pm-10pm
* Try to do it part time, 05:30-08:30 is great.
* working class people TIP GOOD they are your street friends. dont expect rich folks to tip.
* Keep a kind demeanour about you even if you are cranky or tired, be non-judgemental and offer resolutions to customers that are speedy and in their favor. 
* More importantly, stay consistent don't just have a shitty night and quit. Keep at it
* Maintain your acceptance rate above 70, don't decline unless you have an emergency, and even take the shit long distance order that's 15 miles for 8 bucks time to time. I find the algo takes me to busier zones and I just switch zones wherever I land.

Dashing was an absolute bust this evening,"I don't get what the deal was, dashing Friday evenings typically is when I make a crap load of money. Usually back to back orders, great offers with good tips. I figured with the big boxing match this evening that even more people would be ordering so they could stay home and watch the match. Far from the case.

Typically any night of the week I make $70-$150, started dashing at 3PM and stopped about 8:30 and I never even made it to $30 that entire time. Offers were far and few between, a crap ton of no-tip offers. Got a crap ton of lowball offers for like $6 wanting me to deliver 8+ miles away. My AR tanked big time this evening. I typically keep it 85%-90% to maintain platinum status so I can decline crap offers. Ended the night with my AR at 73%. 

I got so many $2 no-tip and $3 offers it was f'king ridiculous. I've never declined so many offers in one night, most evenings the offers are great and don't have to decline any. I don't get what the deal was this evening. I generally don't touch $4 offers, but that's all doordash was throwing me and I wanted to make some $$$ so I just started accepting them as long as they were going less than a mile. Sadly, 5 hours dashing the best offer I got this evening paid $5.50. This was NOT a normal evening of dashing for me.

I’ve done quite a bit from my house just waiting for an offer. My next door neighbor in our attached duplex also dashes and says she never has to wait more than a few minutes for an offer. I’ve done all the tricks. Force closing the app, turning on and off my phone, disconnecting WiFi, logging out and back in, ending and starting a dash, trying hourly pay vs per offer, nothing is working. I’ve tried the chat help 4 times. They repeat the same stuff - including frequently telling me I’m not in a busy zone even when my app actively shows ‘very busy’ when I ask for help. They escalated it 4 times and I got a phone call and she escalated it but couldn’t get ahold of the next person I needed to talk to. She said I’d get an email and I never did.

Double charged ,"TLDR- Doordash had double charged me $300 and denied ever doing so. 

I posted this last week to this sub but I was stressed out about this whole situation to make any ounce of sense.

On Halloween, I had ordered about $300 worth of groceries. I did this because I have a significant back injury and no car. While the driver was shopping, something wasn't available so the price changed/went down. I was like sweet, thanks for the heads up and the dasher had changed it from the app and at the end of the whole order, the amount was corrected to the right amount it was supposed to. 
The next day, I looked at my bank account and saw the adjustment price was already posted on my account. The Saturday morning afterwards, I looked at my bank account and saw that there was a pending charge on my account for another $300. So I called Doordash to see why I was charged again, and when I called, they explained that it was the adjusted price, i told them it wasn't, that it was already posted and that this was a completely different charge. 
When I sent them a screenshot of my bank statement and then I was then told ""No, we didn't charge you that"" even though the new pending charge was the exact same amount and says the exact same thing. When I pointed it out to them and that if they could do anything about it, I was screamed at to ""Fuck you and your payment, it's not our job to figure that fucking shit out."" I had that said to me twice by two separate people trying to figure out why I was charged.

question for my dashers out there,"hi dashers! i am from new york and moved to atlanta for college. 

for context i live off campus with no meal plan and have no drivers license or car (being used to the MTA).  i got student dashpass last year after a friend recommended it to me and this was my first experience w/ doordash bc it was always so expensive.

normally i try to keep it small and order fast food combos and tip $2 because i can’t really afford anything else but this sub has illuminated to me how little my dashers have been making on my cheap taco bell and pizza orders, and i now have a lot of guilt about my inability to be a good tipper as an unemployed student.

my questions are: does dashpass mitigate the lack of tip in any way? would you accept for ex. a biggie bag order with $2 tip if the wendy’s is 1.2 miles away? lastly should i order DD less frequently as to not burden dashers with my bad orders?

Restaurants beware!,"I work for a small chain sports bar and we have been getting hit with a specific scam. The full order comes in to the kitchen no problem, but on the tablet, it only shows the customer ordered a side of sauce. It is SIMILAR to the other side of sauce scam they’ve been doing but it’s different in this sense-

The kitchen received a full order of food with a specific customers name from DoorDash. Multiple entrees. Kitchen starts to prepare as normal. 

As orders are set to automatically send to the kitchen because we get a pretty good to-go business throughout the day, upon reviewing the order, it’s just a side of cheese sauce  which is $1. 

Here’s my hypothesis:
The customer makes their order as normal, and has a pre-loaded script to run, that deletes the full cart, adds a side of cheese sauce to the cart, while the 1-2 second payment processing window is happening. So the “send to kitchen” function is happening before payment is confirmed somehow. 

We’ve been hit for quite a pretty penny on this. Not gonna share numbers but it was hefty. 

Anyone else experience something like this? I’ve been scoping to see if the script exists somewhere. I’m not deep in hacking communities because, well, they’re hard to get into lmao

4.7 miles from restaurant to a hospital.
I was messaged twice before pickup, with the driver straight up asking me to add to the tip. 
The hospital is a big maze, so I gave instructions to come right up to the front. I watched on the map and went to the glass doors to watch when I saw they were close. I watched them park, and pulled the app back up to make sure it was them before walking up. As soon as the app opens I have a third message, ""I cannot wait for you, I'm leaving it by the road"". 
Not even 30 seconds parked before that message. 
So I waved at him while coming out the door as he was getting out of the car, and he still put it on the ground instead of handing it to me. I gave him three stars and marked ""rude"".

Door Dash is so bad… it might be good. ,"Advice on how to make sure as a customer, your orders are correct?

I door dash daily because I was signed up for the annual dash pass without my permission, and when I tried to cancel it within 10 minutes of noticing the subscription charge, they refused. So, I decided to use it as much as possible in the year to get my moneys worth. 

I am not joking when I say for every 10 orders I do, maybe 2 or 3 are correct. Only 1 or 2 of 10 ever come as a complete order with utensils and everything. 

It is my go to now to send a message that says “Hi (dasher,) please double check for (drink/side/food/etc) and utensils as (restaurant) usually forgets. Thank you so much!” As a way to cover my bases as the customer. 

They usually always respond with “will do” but my orders still arrive wrong. I always report it for the difference back, and since I’m a frequent user they often throw on an apology credit with the refund. So i realistically get a lot of things for free because door dash hires incompetent people. 

My question is: what else can I possibly do to ensure my orders are right? I feel bad that the company has to refund me every other day, but I’m also not paying for items I didn’t receive… like paying for a large $7 soda and getting an empty cup and no straw.

Walgreens delivery by DoorDash,"I just ordered an outdoor Christmas light up corgi from Walgreens online.

Well within 5 minutes, my order was picked up by DoorDash?? I tried figuring out how to add a tip, but the link I was sent wouldn’t even allow me to do so. I ordered through the Walgreens website, and it didn’t say anything about a tip. I feel horrible!

Everyone is struggling these days, and I feel terribly guilty that someone just delivered it without proper compensation possibly. While I’m glad I have it sooner, I would have been fine waiting the 2-4 days. So can someone tell me if they receive a higher pay for these orders?

Spending on service,"I’m a dasher and a doordash customer often, So I understand both sides of wanting tips and not wanting to spend a lot on delivery by giving a low tip. But the thing is, you pay for your food and the service if you want it delivered. Doordash also is a corporation so they’re going to obviously take their cut whether or not you agree it should be lower so they can pay drivers more. I understand the regular definition of a tip as being an extra if you receive especially good service, so on doordash I think using the word tip when in actuality you’re paying to receive the service in the first place instead of giving extra for good service, is a misnomer because it leads some customers to believe that it’s an extra payment for good service when in reality it’s going to be the majority of what a dasher makes and should be based on how badly you need something delivered and how much you think a dasher deserves for completing a service for you. I agree that it should be doordash paying us but the fact is that they aren’t.

Then on top of that at certain restaurants they want you to get a staff member to open the bag and have them show you each item while you check it off a checklist. This pisses most of the staff off especially if they’re busy at the time. They also been making me take pictures of the receipts at certain restaurants. All these extra steps take more time not less.

PSA for Dashers & question for customers.,"I'm both a Dasher and a DD customer. Dear Dashers who Smoke:

Your smoke permeates your orders. It makes them smell and taste foul. Stop being gross and smoking your cancer sticks in the car with your customers' food. They can and will complain and you can and will either be dinged for it or be locked out as a Dasher. Customers have respiratory issues. Customers have allergies. Customers have asthma. And if a customer tells you ""next time, consider your customer and don't smoke with their order in the car"", don't snap back with ""then go and get it yourself, I'm grown, b\*\*\*\*"".

Not everyone engages in your vice and it causes active harm to some people. Stop it.

Sincerely,

A Dasher & DoorDash customer who ISN'T nasty.

Driving vs Parked Getting Orders,"I have 2 major hotspots in my zone where I return to and park if orders are not coming in. They are about 4.5 miles apart on each side of the city. I know when each is busy and at what time, so I coordinate accordingly. There are other hotspots, but those are unimportant for this story.

I swear that Doordash wants me to drive around burning gas for no reason!!! I can be sitting in one area with no orders coming in and the very second I pull out to leave or shortly after, to go to the other side, they start bombarding me with orders from the side I'm leaving. And vice-versa! Never fails. Yesterday lunch was over, and things slowed down, so I was halfway to the other side. They started sending order after order, like they were trying to get me to come back while I drove to the other side. They didn't stop until I made it! I know dang well, there were more than enough Dashers available on that side that were without orders.

The point is that I can sit and not get any orders, and then shortly after I start driving, bam!!

Seems like Doordash just wants me to burn gas or wait until I'm miles away from the restaurants / area before they want me there! 🤣🤣

And I have a pet peeve anyway. If I am tired of an area and I have decided to move somewhere else and I'm moving away... don't be sending me orders behind me unless they are worth $20 or more... because I'm not doing any u-turns, waiting on stoplights, or pulling into parking lots to turn the heck around.

Question for everyone unhappy with DoorDash,"So like, I was a Dasher and used to use DD for a number of years when I owned a business in which I could not leave to get food, and it was a nice perk to offer my employees. It’s gone downhill fast in the last year or so, not sure if those of you who used it when it was first out agree that it was better, service wise?

My question is though, why aren’t we, unhappy customers and dashers as a whole kinda doing anything about their absolutely horrible downturn in business practices? Like tanking their ratings on all possible platforms, App Store, BBB, wherever is possible to leave DoorDash a rating? 
I know it feels like nudging their 4.8 star rating on Apple App Store from over a million reviews seems pointless, but like… if enough folks do something, and explain why they’re so unhappy… maybe something will give?

I dunno, I just am so dejected that a service I was once really happy with has gone in the toilet. And every time I read about something awful happening to someone on here and DD customer service not doing anything and not caring… I feel worse. I am upset for everyone who is done wrong. I feel like something must be able to be done…there has to be.

ACME deliveries ,"I ordered my first order from ACME via the ACME app. The ACME app asked if I wanted my groceries handed to me or left at the front door.  I checked off “left at front door” 
As I’m driving home, a call comes through on my cell phone from”Texas” so I almost ignored it but last second picked it up. 
A woman asks me if I ordered from door dash. I said no. 
She said you didn’t order groceries from ACME? 
I replied I didn’t know that ACME used door dash. 
She then asked if I wanted the groceries left at the front door. I said yes and thanked her. 
So there must be some disconnect between the ACME app and the Door dash app. 
Any ideas how to avoid calls from them in the future?

Disconnect When Ordering From Restaurant And Delivery From Door Dash - Wendy's,"This has happened to me for the second time. I placed an order through the Wendy's app. It asks me for delivery instructions, I write in where to leave the order, and to please not ring the bell. The order is sent to Door Dash for 3rd party delivery, and I get a notification there are missing delivery instructions. What it wants is an apartment number which they don't need as we live in a house. But then I see under further instructions it says ""hand to me."" I edit that and put the same instructions in for where to leave the order.

I have a sick husband freshly home from the hospital and two large dogs (who rightfully scare the crap out of people) who aren't fans of people coming to the door. I just want a simple, hassle free delivery to feed me and the kid.

The driver comes up to the door (I am watching on the camera with the dogs in another room hoping to avoid a fuss) and he bangs on the door. About two seconds later he is ringing the bell, then bangs again, and rings the bell TWO MORE TIMES.

I open the door a crack - the dogs are losing their minds - and say ""please leave the food on the chair, per the instructions."" And close the door. And go back to watching the camera. He looks confused, then a bit pissed, and turns and looks as though he's going to walk away with the food. Then he yells at the car ""get my phone"" before putting the food on the chair, giving up on whoever he was yelling to, and leaves.

Where is the disconnect? I don't know if I should be upset with the dasher for not following instructions or upset with Wendy's for not relaying information, or with Door Dash for not relaying information. But I can say it has happened twice now when ordering through the Wendy's app.

To a lesser degree, I have always wondered why it was such a big deal on their end whether the order is left at the door or handed off. If handed off they don't get any kind of proof. They know they handed it off but they don't take a picture of the customer or get a code or anything that would prove they handed it off. So if something goes south it's kind of a he said/she said situation. But if it's left per the customer's instruction they have to take a photo.",customer,,doordash,3,1,1.0,FrankieMaddox,n,1,1,,,disconnect order restaurant delivery door dash wendys,happen second time place order wendys app ask delivery instruction write leave order please ring bell order send door dash rd party delivery get notification miss delivery instruction want apartment number dont need live house see instruction say hand edit put instruction leave order sick husband freshly home hospital two large dog rightfully scare crap people arent fan people come door want simple hassle free delivery fee kid driver come door watch camera dog another room hop avoid fuss bang door two second later ring bell bang ring bell two time open door crack dog lose mind say please leave food chair per instruction close door go back watch camera look confused bit pissed turn look though he go walk away food yell car get phone put food chair give whoever yell leaf disconnect dont know upset dasher follow instruction upset wendys relay information door dash relay information say happen twice order wendys app less degree always wonder big deal end whether order leave door hand hand dont get kind proof know hand dont take picture customer get code anything would prove hand something go south kind saidshe say situation left per customer instruction take photo,0,0,disconnect order restaurant delivery door dash wendys happen second time place order wendys app ask delivery instruction write leave order please ring bell order send door dash rd party delivery get notification miss delivery instruction want apartment number dont need live house see instruction say hand edit put instruction leave order sick husband freshly home hospital two large dog rightfully scare crap people arent fan people come door want simple hassle free delivery fee kid driver come door watch camera dog another room hop avoid fuss bang door two second later ring bell bang ring bell two time open door crack dog lose mind say please leave food chair per instruction close door go back watch camera look confused bit pissed turn look though he go walk away food yell car get phone put food chair give whoever yell leaf disconnect dont know upset dasher follow instruction upset wendys relay information door dash relay information say happen twice order wendys app less degree always wonder big deal end whether order leave door hand hand dont get kind proof know hand dont take picture customer get code anything would prove hand something go south kind saidshe say situation left per customer instruction take photo,7,196,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}","{'neg': 0.146, 'neu': 0.707, 'pos': 0.148, 'compound': 0.3515}",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.148,0.146,0.707,0.3515,0

She lived on the third floor so I had to carry it up, but I don’t really care because I need the exercise. When I got to her door, she gave me her ID to check and was super apologetic about the stairs. I told her no problem, I don’t mind, but she insisted she was going to add to my tip for having to go up the stairs.

Left, went home, noticed she never added to the extra tip but just blew it off. But now I see she complained to DoorDash about the substitution? It’s literally the substitution she picked herself.

My order had 40 items, mostly produce and meat. I made sure to not include any annoyingly heavy items (no packs of water, soda, dog food, etc) because I don’t want to be a burden on anyone. 


He was able to get everything pretty quickly and only needed to refund or substitute a few  items and was communicative and kind. My initial tip when I placed my order was 20% ($17) - is this an okay tip? The store is ~12 miles away, with 75% of it being highway miles. 


I definitely want to make it worth it for the dasher so please give me your opinions and advice! Thank you!

Possible Scam: Customer's Perspective,"Wanted to share in case this helps anyone/ wondering if anyone had a similar experience.

I order a bag of dog food through Petco, which uses doordash drivers.

Right as the order was supposed to be delivered, I had two calls come one from a man followed by a woman within minutes of each other asking if my order had been delivered. They both hung up quickly after I told them no, but the map shows it should be soon. The woman claimed that the driver said it had been delivered. I don't recall giving them any personal information, but may have confirmed my phone number? I don't recall.

Shortly after I got a text from petco saying my order was delivered and to call my dasher ""Robert"" if there was any issues. I had not recieved the item, and when I called the number it was an old lady who did not know who Robert was.

I called doordash support, they said that they had not called me. They said they had a different number on file than the one petco's doordash number provided me ( I know this is petco's number as they provided me with the doordash tracking and I've gotten order texts from them before). They did not recieve a picture from the driver. They dispatched a new dasher.

The new dasher called me from Petco saying that Petco gave my dog food to the first dasher an hour prior and that I need to call Petco support to dispatch a new order, so the new dasher could not even pick up my order despite already being there, so they had to cancel my order. I felt bad for the dasher who drove there with no order to pick up, but she was very understanding about it.

Given the discrepency in the phone number for the initial dasher, I'm pretty sure the dasher just stole it. But maybe someone scammed the initial dasher and changed the numbers? Why would ""doordash"" call me to ask if the order was delivered?

FT KNOX DOORDASHING,"Hey everyone. I did doordash awhile back in London, KY. I recently relocated to Elizabethtown, KY. I started doordash again over the weekend and only got 38 orders toward my 100 to get platinum perks from Friday to today (Monday). There must be a ton of dashers in Etown because it hardly let's me dash now during lunch and dinner rushes, and when it does, it's only for 30 minute increments then cuts me off. Even scheduling doesn't have Etown hardly until like 4-5 days later with awful times for example of 2-330 am. I have a full-time job Tuesday-Friday from 7am-5:30pm, so I'm just dashing after work and of course Saturday-Monday when I can.

The reason I started dashing again is because the paychecks from my regular 40 hr job are literally gone every week. It takes every penny I have to afford my bills. I've made a lot of dumb choices with loans and credit cards, and when adding rent, car payment, insurance, utilities, etc I am 100% broke on Fridays. When I say I don't have a penny left from those checks, I mean it. While I'm not too upset about being broke because all my bills are paid which is most important for me, it's really hard to do anything else. I can't even afford a McDouble if I wanted it and occasionally it does get frustrating and mentally exhausting.

That being said, I relocated here to start a life with  my girlfriend who I had a long distance relationship with. She's literally the best thing that has ever happened to me and I know people say this all the time, but this woman truly, TRULY!!, saved my life. She got me away from all the bad stuff I was doing and still loves me solely for me and nothing else. She loved the good and the bad and doesn't judge me in the slightest for my past. She's the biggest blessing aside from my daughter that I've ever received in my life, and I'm extremely grateful to have her and try my best to make sure she knows everyday she's alive how beautiful, amazing, and loved she is by me.

All that sappy stuff aside lol, I am doordashing to save up to buy her an engagement ring. The one I want is $1500. I made $254 last weekend, and I'm trying my hardest to make the money by Christmas. I am willing to work my ass off to achieve that, honestly. I just want to make her happy is all.

I was hoping someone in here is from the Etown area and could tell me what dashing on Ft. Knox is like and if it's worth it. They are always showing as either very busy to busy the entire day. It even let's you schedule the entire day the next day from 7am-9pm instead of 4-5 days later like Etown does. I'm pretty sure they're open to dashing from 7am-9pm everyday, but I may be wrong. I know you have to go to the visitors center to get a 1 year pass, I do know that.

My main question is, do they order a lot from places on base, or is it mostly off base then back on? I really don't want to have to go to Etown and back over and over 100x a day. Radcliff wouldn't be so bad, or on base even better. My brother works for the DoD and has to go in office 2 days a week on base and he said the MPs are really strict about speeding as well so much so that he said they've pulled people over and immediately searched their car. Are they really that strict? I just don't see it being worthwhile to drive to say Dunkin in Etown from base then back for $5.50 and also always looking over my shoulder to get pulled over doing 37 in a 35. If anyone has any experience there, please let me know so if it's worth it, I can be down Saturday to get my pass and hopefully make some good money to get closer to getting this ring.

Totally understand the part about requesting a rating, but I think it becomes a boundary issue of unprofessionalism when a worker is essentially complaining to the customer about what DoorDash pays them.

Unable to tip for petsmart delivery,"Just want to preface that door dash paid my bills for awhile last year, so I’ve been down in the trenches with you dashers. I still do gig work and turn DD on occasionally, so I’m aware how rough it is out there.

My order confirmation said nothing about being delivered by DD, and I didn’t order for same day delivery or anything like that. I ordered on the 8th and it was delivered yesterday, so I assumed it was coming via ups/fedex. I don’t recall seeing an option to add a tip or I absolutely would have. It doesn’t show up in my door dash app. I’m sure the guy who delivered my order didn’t get a fair cut, so I feel bad 😭

DASH HACKS,"I just wanted to offer up a few tips and tricks I've picked up over nearly 1k dashes. I've made some damn good money when I had to. Dash during prime time! Lunch and dinner; there's usually a good 4-4.5hr window for both depending on your market. Try to hang around areas with alot of dining options, from fast food to sometimes fine dining. Try to avoid areas that you know don't, or probably won't tip. Every city has bad areas. Don't be afraid to decline the BS  Try to accept orders that average  $1.50+/mile; that's really the only way to start making decent money but it's honestly not always possible to do that. Now if a $20 15 mile order comes in, I'm prolly taking that, and if it's a slow time of day, I'll take some BS just to pass the time it keep my rates up. If you have to pause your dash for a short bit to get back to a good zone, then do it. Look at the customer instructions and map before you leave. GPS isn't always right and if you know the area, short cuts can save you so much time. Especially during rush hour or in high traffic areas. TIME IS MONEY! Communicate with the customer via text from wait time to eta with the order. I get so many added tips and cash tips just because I communicate, and sometimes BS with the customer. Most importantly, please take your appearance, and your vehicle's if possible, seriously. Nobody wants someone who looks like they smell funny handling their food lol. Be friendly and smile with your entire face; body language speaks volumes. Just remember that ultimately, we're in the customer service business. It feels like I've been rambling, but it's because stuff just kept coming to me and I'm sure there's more. There's definitely money to be made if you really want to make it. I hope this helps.

Terrible dasher experience ,"Just got my order a few mins ago, and the dasher had over 15,000 deliveries with a 4.8 rating. And the result is a pizza that looked like it wasn't taken care of at all during the delivery process. I don't know how it's possible to have that many deliveries as a dasher and not know pizza needs to be handled horizontally when delivering? I had to rewind security camera footage to see what happened and this dasher on his bike handled the pizza like it was a book. Also, when he took it out his book bag vertically, he proceeded to shake the pizza box as if it that was going to help. SMH. I did get my money back after sending photos to customer service, but this shouldn't really be happening.

Update: I've added camera footage of this great dasher, to back up my claims. I'm saddened that there are people who actually defend this type of service as being acceptable.

Question for Dashers in New York City— do you see the order ahead of time? ,"So I regularly use DoorDash for large grocery orders. I don’t have a car and I have physical limitations so this has been a great option. I always tip despite the fact that there is apparently an hourly rate and always tip pretty well. Just getting that out of the way. I placed an order from a grocery store that had a fair amount of items, nothing too crazy… I see the Dasher that accepts the order is on a bike apparently. Assuming that the little icon thing that DoorDash shows is accurate. It takes this person quite a long time to reach the grocery store and by the time they do, they call me angrily saying that I ordered too much for DoorDash. The person had very broken English, but I kept telling them to cancel the order and they never did but acted as if the majority of items were out of stock… they were definitely not the kind of items that would be out of stock. My order total was about $100 and they delivered maybe a third of it. I had already tipped and I was pissed off about this. Customer service was essentially useless, but after badgering them a few times they gave me DoorDash credits to make up for the balance. What happened here? Doesn’t the Dasher see what the order is? And if they can accept it? Like I would assume that some people avoid orders from certain stores because it’s too out-of-the-way or they don’t want to go there or whatever. Why would this person do this?

Just got scammed out of an Uber eats promo by live chat agents,"I just spent half an hour being lied to by 3 uber eats live chat agents and essentially getting scammed out of a promo. I have no idea if I can get a resolution for this - if anyone has ideas, let me know, but atleast I am going to put my story here for awareness. 

I'm an Uber One member, and I've been getting 30% off takeout promos from uber eats in my email for several months now that have never shown up in my app. I finally contacted support about it. In short, here's what I got from each agent:

* **Agent 1:** yes you are eligible for the promo, sorry the app glitches sometimes, just make an order and we'll apply the coupon after. No way he could get the promo to show on my app. 
* **Agent 2:** First kept talking about refunds for no reason. Then kept referring to a previous order, saying it's been over 48 hours so a coupon can't be applied, when the order I made was literally 10 minutes ago.
* **Agent 3:** This one used several excuses on me: 
   * First, he said my promo was expired. I proved to him through photos that it clearly wasn't, and a previous agent confirmed it.
   * Then said I had a 30% off promo that expires Dec 2nd, and I can use it on my next order (the email shows it expires tomorrow). I said this is wrong and your agent told me I can use it on this order
   * Then he said he can't apply it because the order is live. During our convo it actually got delivered so I said it wasn't live anymore, so it could be applied.
   * Then he said it had to be applied beforehand, and I can apply it next order instead. Which obviously I can't because they DON'T SHOW ON THE APP, also your AGENT TOLD ME IT WOULD BE APPLIED AFTER, GUARANTEED.

Here's an imgur link of the promo and some of the conversations I screenshotted for proof: [https://imgur.com/a/qJ5R3KV](https://imgur.com/a/qJ5R3KV)

"""Powered by Uber""","Had an issue the other day ordering from a local pizza restaurant that I have been wanting to try. I went directly to their website, and saw that there was both pick up and delivery options. I thought, sweet! Delivery! and clicked through to the menu, placed my order, and input my credit card for payment. Order placed, done deal, seemed easy. 

Fast forward to my scheduled delivery time. I have an email from Uber Eats in my inbox, stating that my order had been picked up by the driver, Sami, and that delivery had been completed. First, I did not know that I was interacting with Uber Eats on the restaurant's website. I've gone back and looked and could see that it wasn't clearly identified up front, unless you scrolled down to the bottom and saw in 8 point type ""Powered by Uber"" on the footer, and at checkout, and even then just a discreet ""Uber Eats"" at the top that immediately disappears when you scroll down to where you put in payment details.

At any rate, my delivery never arrived. I contacted the restaurant, they confirmed that the order was picked up, and that if I had an issue I should contact Uber Eats. I pressed on them a bit harder and they agreed to refund. 

I then contacted Uber Eats, since the restaurant informed me that it was clearly Uber's fault. And this is where it gets stupid. I had screen shots of the receipts showing the order paid for, delivered, and then (insult to injury) a tip being paid out an hour later. Uber's response - since I was contacting them via my phone number linked to my Uber account - ""You didn't place the order, we have no record of it, therefore there is nothing we can do to help you."" This even after showing them receipts of the order and my notification from AMEX of the charge from UberEats.

What I found infuriating was that there was no interest on Uber's part to research this and find out who the driver was that enjoyed a really good pizza and a decent 20% tip. I ""spoke"" (chatted) with two different Uber reps and both said the same thing, then said that there would be email follow up (which of course never arrived). 

If anyone has any suggestions on how to contact Uber to resolved this I would appreciate it, but the Chat Bros I interacted with were clearly not equipped or empowered to help me.

New Ux design for tipping is awful!,"Ever since they changed the process for adding a tip ( to only happen once a delivery is completed, rather than before), I keep having problems with it. 

It’s such a shitty design.

First, you have to scroll down to actually see it, it is really easy to complete the driver review and miss the option completely as it’s not viewable   on the first available screen. 

Fine, so I miss it, I get a chance to go back and add one. Whenever I try that, it declines. My food transactions all approve, but the tips ones won’t. 

WTF Uber? Are you trying to rip off your drivers even more?

I’m trying my best here to support my delivery drivers - I used to be able do it all in one transaction- now I have to remember to do a second transaction via the review, if I scroll past it and miss it, and then try again, it fails.

Worst service ever,"So I just placed an order through a restaurant's website not knowing they use Uber Eats as a third party. The order should have been around $27 dollars. After placing the order my credit card got charged $45 with no break down of the bill. I didn't get any confirmation by email or text (I had inputted my details already) and have no receipt whatsoever.

I called the restaurant and they told me to take it up with Uber Eats. Uber Eats has no contact number to call and I waited over an hour to ""connect to an agent"" for their chat service. After which I was told to send a message describing the issue and that they'd try getting back to me in 6-12 hours. I have no proof of this order except for my credit card charge (for $45) and the receipt from the restaurant (stapled to the order which confirms the $27 bill).

On top of that, the driver arrived late because his GPS took him elsewhere. Since I had no contact with the driver because I didn't order through an app or account (just directly from the restaurant's website), I had to stand outside in the cold and dark outside my building waving at every car that passed by. The driver finally saw me and I received my cold overpriced order.

I am beyond frustrated. I paid almost double what I was supposed to pay without prior notice or consent. No explanation as to why. No paper trail since I never received any kind of communication from Uber Eats.

I'll never ever ever ever order online again. I'd rather drive however long I need to and pick up my own order.

Any advice if anyone's been through something similar before?


Update: I got an email receipt 2 hours later and I can now see they added a tip, a service fee, delivery fee and tax (which I already expected of course) on top. So that all added up.

Something is not adding up...Offers.,"So I got a delivery today for $35.00 including tip.  After I dropped off, total was 32.00 including tip. Tip was not reduced. Then again I received a 15.00 order and after delivery it went to 12.00. I started second guessing myself thinking that maybe the offers were actually 32 and 12 but my wife was with me and she said she saw the same total offer of 35 and 15. Is Uber doing a little bait and switch??? 

I'm going to start to screen shot my offers to make sure im not imagining the offers.  Again, the tip was not reduced or else it would have said that in the message box after delivery.

"My food got stolen, and they won’t refund me.","So earlier today my wife and I ordered Wingstop. Usually I just go pick it up but she was sick, and I didn’t want to spread germs. We got the bundle with wings and fries, and corn with an extra ranch.
The girl picked it up quick and got it to our house pretty fast. I tipped super well, and the only thing request I had was that she put it on the bottom stair. I was super kind…

However, when the food got here, the staples on the bag had been removed (There was one still on there and we saw the holes.), and there was no sticker seal like usual. Not to mention it looked just wrong compared to what the bags usually look like, and no receipt.

I brought the food in, and noticed it was so light. Like when everything is in there, the bag is always heavy. 
So I quickly opened it to realize that the fries and every single ranch was missing. Then when we opened our chicken box, there was 2 of each flavor missing.
At first I was like “It was probably Wingstop messing up.”, but with the bag being open and the chicken, I think our driver took it.

I tried to dispute it and uber eats said 
“Sorry nothing we can do about it.”, and I tried to get in touch with them over email and calling but no one will answer.

 open a ticket but lie about the issue say ""I had a driver threaten me or food was left with a hate message"".

this will put a red flag on the AI chat and they will connect you with a real person and that person will ask for your phone number  (i have done this twice).

once they call you simply explained you lied to get a real customer
service agent and vent your issue.

finally uninstall this garbage app.

Driver accepted order just to harrass me via chat messages,"Has anyone ever had a driver accept your order just to harrass you?

Delivery Horror Story,"I want to know if anything similar has happened to any other drivers, probably speaking to the women only on this one. 

I deliver overnight and I am always wary of my surroundings and I make sure I’m not in one area for too long, especially always deliver in the better areas although safety is not guaranteed anywhere tbh. 

But anyway as I was finishing up one night and just about to get home I get one last order for a single item from a coffee shop but it looked like the tip was $20. It was only a few miles into the next town too, and I obviously immediately accept it. As I was delivering I was thinking to myself why is this person putting such a hefty tip on such a small order. But then I saw it was leave at door so I wasn’t overthinking it, I figured I won’t have to interact with anyone, and maybe I’m just being tip baited at worst. 

Unfortunately once I arrive to the door (last house on a dead end street, and the spot was a side door, absolutely no lighting except for a tiny light above the door) a young man peeks his head out. He’s talking like he’s high as a kite and I can barely hear a word he’s saying. I wasn’t sure if he was mentally challenged or drugged up but I was trying to be professional. I hand him his order and then he very quietly says “can you come inside and help me with something for that $20 tip?” Then proceeds to pull out his pecker and inch closer. 

When I tell y’all I immediately ran back to my car feeling violated as hell, and I didn’t even three point turn, I just backed tf up out of that street as fast as I possibly could. I didn’t even realize I could drive in reverse so well under fight or flight circumstances but I’m glad I could. I immediately called Uber and I admit I was crying and shaking. This man also REPORTED me and canceled the order. After hearing me cry and speaking to what sounded like someone important in the safety department lol, Uber give me the full amount of what the order was including tip. Uber then blocked the customer for me, but I don’t think they are banned off the platform, and I didn’t bother with filing a report for a gray situation like this, where probably nothing would happen. But imagine feeling like you need mild compensation for experiencing something like this on the job, bc that’s how it felt lol. 

I had to take a break for a few days after this and now I’m sometimes on edge. Just the other day some guy came outside to collect his order then starts small talk and complaining about his depression/divorce and then offered me $200 “just for some company” I’m sorry sir but your eyes are asking for more than just company. Disgusting. But I got out of that situation so smoothly that he still left me $20 tip and no thumbs down thank god. 

I don’t plan to be doing this much longer thankfully. But where is the humanity? This is why women say they choose the bear. I don’t think those men understand how scary it is for y’all to approach us in any sexual way in the middle of the night when we’re simply supposed to be just delivering food. There is absolutely no work setting for me where I’m not going to get sexualized or borderline harassed by a man in some way. 

I’m just ranting and this happened months ago but like i just had to get it out. I still can’t believe it happened. I am just so grateful to be alright minus some visual and emotional scarring. And before some man comments “seriously don’t be so dramatic about how it affected you” honestly just don’t comment, it might seem like nothing to you but being flashed with genitalia in the middle of the night in a dark unknown place and literally being baited there with a tip is indeed a scary situation as a woman. And not only scary but incredibly dehumanizing.

Is this normal for uber eats? ,"I ordered food and I had ""knock and leave food at door"" for my delivery instructions. The dude showed up and stood at my door for a bit, and I was waiting for him to put the food down and leave, and then he started to walk away WITH my bag of food. Then I opened the door and came outside because he was leaving with my food! I had my blinds open and the dude could see me waiting. I have no contact delivery set up for a reason. 


Are my delivery instructions not clear enough? Do I need to change something to keep this from happening? The apartment number is right by my front door so I know he knew the food was at the right place and wasn't leaving because of a wrong address. 


I didn't even see this message until after he left (was marked as spam). I thought uber eats policy was to leave the food at the door if the customer doesn't answer? Do they cancel the order and take the food back if you don't open the door now? It was just a strange interaction and I'm curious if this is a normal thing now.

How UE is like the driver's narcissist significant other,"I'm new-ish as a driver.  For a while at first, there was a message on my screen every time I went online that read ""Your cancellation rate is higher than average in your area.""  Go figure, I canceled the 5th or 6th order I accepted because I was nervous and accepted it by accident, so then it was a ""big"" percent of my total, until I accumulated enough good ones to make that message finally stop showing .......

....... only to be replaced by a different accusation:

And yes we're talking about the very first thing I see when I go online and hear that cheerful chime at the start of my evening.  -Gee Uber Eats, if your goal is to make me feel inadequate, why stop there?  Why not tell me something like:

Now what is interesting is that although I CAN find my cancellation rate, I don't see any comparison to other drivers in my area.

And as for *acceptance rate* \-LOL, WHERE IS THAT?  NEVER MIND THE ALLEGED ""AVERAGE"" ACCEPTANCE RATE OF OTHER DRIVERS IN MY AREA!

Tell me in the comments if you ever see this brown cartouche warning about your acceptance rate.  Or maybe I should say tell me if you HAVEN'T seen it.  Because I would suspect that they show it to all of us.

I'll tell you why I think that, and why I don't let it bother me one bit.  My main gig, which I've been doing for several years, is eBay.  And they do something similar.  That is, they apply pressure to increase your sales in various ways, including subtle suggestions that you're not as good as other sellers.  The biggest example is with their promotion stuff, which go figure, because it increases THEIR revenues.  -The higher percent of an item's sale that you pledge to pay for increased visibility, the higher the likelihood it will be seen and sold.  As for how that is assessed and whether or not it's honest, that's another can of worms.

But here's what that looks like:

The last few days I’m noticing something fishy.
I’m making multiple deliveries in one trip but don’t seem to be getting paid what the order initially shows.

For example I picked up an order today it said 12 and change when I accepted it
Than accepted another one form the same restaurant that came up as +10 and change when I accepted it

After leaving I automatically had a third pickup from another restaurant that I never accepted, that happens sometimes I don’t usually mind.

I dropped them all off and now all I recieved was 8 dollars and a tip processing and the only order listed is the first one from the first restaurant.

Getting out of a customer service standard response loop?,"
When I lived in a city, I used ubereats more often than I’d like to admit. If I had an issue with an order ie wrong item  or if the items came spilled or cold, I recall it would often take a few messages to break their standard customer service lines and get a resolution. They have since streamlined this and you can mostly get these things remedied by filling out a form. However, this doesn’t sort the issue out when it’s slightly more complicated than the form can compute. 

Recently, I’ve got stuck in this customer service loop twice with both times them telling me the matter is final and will not be responded to again. The first time was actually me doing it on a friends account about an incident she reported to the police re her Ubereats driver. I won’t go into details here but can if folk want to know more. 

Second is more standard. On Monday, I ordered food from a chain restaurant with another friend. We normally order on whatever delivery app has the best rates/deals. The veggie burger my friend orders can be made dairy free/vegan by removing some condiments. On Justeat and Deliveroo this is a tickbox but on Uber, you need to “customise” it ie adding/removing condiments. Nevertheless, even when using Uber it comes vegan. She also customised it to have additional salad on it which was free of charge. This time the burger came with the non-vegan condiments so she could not eat it. I reported this to Uber. Uber kept saying they can’t do anything as the condiments didn’t cost money. They have not engaged with the fact the dish was wrong and if we were sitting in, this would be rectified or refunded. They keep focusing on the burger not having the extra salad, and how they cannot do anything as the extra salad was free, which is not the issue. It’s the inclusion of the condiment she cannot eat. What ways can I get through to them on this? We’ve sent photographs of the burger, our receipt and also the restaurants own website explaining how to make the burger dairy free.

New to Uber," I decided to try being a delivery driver for UberEats and I was going through the history of my calls tonight.

 You definitely can’t do this full time with the tip system that’s for sure! I went into knowing that they would be bad but I had to seriously chuckle to myself seeing how bad they really were. 

 Most people literally only give like .50 to 1.00 and some of these orders were over 13km to 15km. At least the Uber Base pay was decent.

Ever since they allowed multiple pick-ups.

I have an issue which constantly happens. 

Order states ""waiting on pickup"" ... Last time sat there for 50 minutes.  Restaurant called and said they picked up at 6:25, yet at 7:20 still showing waiting to be picked up.

Restaurant called Uber to complain.  

When driver arrived I questioned him.  He said he had another delivery which took a while. 

BUT ... that normally shows in app.  So, clearly the driver did other deliveries in another platform and took over an hour to arrive.  He didn't care at all.

So, I complain to Uber and their support is USELESS.  You can't speak directly to someone unless you type in numerous times ""speak to a real person"".

Is it normal for the *alcohol background check to take so long?,"When I set up my (regular) UE delivery account about a month ago, I don't remember the amount of time it took for the background check but it was negligible, 24 hours or less I'm pretty sure.  Shortly after I started taking deliveries, the app offered me the Mastercard for instant payments so I got that.  It also offered me the card/account for shopping orders -I haven't pursued that yet but I might at some point.    
  
Then it offered me the alcohol delivery option. Even though I'm a near-100% teetotaler myself, I jumped right on it for a couple reasons: 1. From the various kinds of businesses I've worked as a server, I know that alcohol adds a whole other level of tip lucrativeness, and 2. I would rather safely bring alcohol to wherever people want to drink it than to have them drive home drunk from bars, or to stores to buy more after they've already been drinking.  

But my application has sat like this for at least a week, maybe 2.  Is this unusual?  How much longer would you wait before trying to contact Uber to see if something went wrong?

I then chatted with someone else. This person was even less inclined to help me. I then found a number and spoke to a human who helped me right away and refunded me the money in my Uber cash so I could place the order again.

Such a scam in the way,"I live in Seattle. I normally use Uber eats to place order for pickup since a lot of restaurants really use uber eats for their takeout orders.

The problem is the Seattle tax which a $13 order will end up $28 in delivery which is crazy.

However! Today! A quick finger of mine didn’t place an order from “pick up” instead of delivery.  I realized the mistake and cancelled the order right away.  Chipotle stated they don’t deal with order itself if it’s been ordered through Uber eats.  Yet Uber eats shows chipotle picked up the order and already worked on the food within 2 minutes of offer “which seems super unlikely but okay?”…. And due to the order had been processed, a cancellation will subject to be the same as food had been made. So cancellation without delivery would still cost me full price of meal.

So the million dollar question is. If that’s the case for cancellation and since I already PAID for the food. Can I go pick up my food that I paid? NOPE! What uber eats meant is “no matter food had been made or not! The order had been gone through Uber eats it means the transaction has been made and cancellation doesn’t matter! They charged me full price of food anyway”.

That leaves which a sour taste for me. If it’s not that I get my Uber eats credits from my American Express. I am most likely will NEVER order through Uber eats. Not only the charge of food delivery is 200% from picking up myself.  The cancellation that food hasn’t even been made will charge full price is ridiculous.

It makes zero sense for me to even use the service because chipotle was walking distance to my place. And uber eats makes “delivery” as app default just simply good for their business and bad for users.",,,UberEATS,19,0,0.43,photodesignch,n,1,1,,,scam way,live seattle normally use uber eats place order pickup since lot restaurant really use uber eats takeout order problem seattle tax order end delivery crazy however today quick finger mine didnt place order pick instead delivery realize mistake cancel order right away chipotle state dont deal order order uber eats yet uber eats show chipotle pick order already work food within minute offer seem super unlikely okay due order process cancellation subject food make cancellation without delivery would still cost full price meal million dollar question thats case cancellation since already pay food go pick food pay nope uber eats meant matter food make order go uber eats mean transaction make cancellation doesnt matter charge full price food anyway leave sour taste get uber eats credit american express likely never order uber eats charge food delivery pick cancellation food hasnt even make charge full price ridiculous make zero sense even use service chipotle walk distance place uber eats make delivery app default simply good business bad user,0,0,scam way live seattle normally use uber eats place order pickup since lot restaurant really use uber eats takeout order problem seattle tax order end delivery crazy however today quick finger mine didnt place order pick instead delivery realize mistake cancel order right away chipotle state dont deal order order uber eats yet uber eats show chipotle pick order already work food within minute offer seem super unlikely okay due order process cancellation subject food make cancellation without delivery would still cost full price meal million dollar question thats case cancellation since already pay food go pick food pay nope uber eats meant matter food make order go uber eats mean transaction make cancellation doesnt matter charge full price food anyway leave sour taste get uber eats credit american express likely never order uber eats charge food delivery pick cancellation food hasnt even make charge full price ridiculous make zero sense even use service chipotle walk distance place uber eats make delivery app default simply good business bad user,2,167,"{'neg': 0.787, 'neu': 0.213, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5719}","{'neg': 0.105, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': -0.4929}",0.0,0.787,0.213,-0.5719,0.077,0.105,0.818,-0.4929,0
Need Help with Uber Eats Refund Issue – Delivery Driver Misused Code,"Hi everyone,

I’m facing an issue with Uber Eats and could use some advice. I recently placed an order, and the delivery driver contacted me to inform me that the restaurant was closed. He then asked for the **delivery confirmation code** (the one you’re supposed to give when the driver arrives) to ""cancel"" the order. Trusting him, I gave him the code.

Now, the app has marked the order as delivered, and I’m unable to request a refund. When I contacted Uber Eats support via the app, they kept repeating the same thing: *“You gave the code, so the delivery is considered complete.”* They don’t seem to understand my situation, and I’m stuck without a refund for an order I never received.

I also tried emailing Uber Eats ([support@uber.com]()), but their email isn’t working.

What else can I do? Has anyone else dealt with a similar issue? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Overnight Ubereats and DoorDash issues.,"I’ve done Ubereats for months. I’ve only done Thursday to Sunday or Friday to Sunday.
Time 10pm - 6am.
I do this because of low traffic and fast food lobbies are closed so you only have to go thru drive thru.

Issues I’ve noticed is the wait time for orders. 
Even if I’m the first or only person in line or stuck in drive thru speaker order waiting to hear a person speak it always takes 5-20mins to receive the order. If I’m lucky some places have it done. I’ve seen many workers during this time take their time or on their phones while I wait for order. 
I still update app and customer but I can’t cancel order if this is like this everywhere. 

Especially at night when fewer delivery drivers are out so you can get orders semi close or further. 
I get it’s my choice for choosing to work late. But I think both companies could be more understanding on the wait time and miles. The more time it takes the less money you make. The less drivers there are the more money for active drivers should make. 
Just my opinion on working overnight.

As for app. GPS doesn’t always take you to entrance.
Wait time is also long since you have to use gate code, guard entrance, finding building and what floor or what side of buildings. That all is taking up time. If I could have only houses pop up on my orders it be great. But the ones with community guards you still have to wait 5 mins to enter. 
DoorDash entering the last 3 digits that’s already on the order to complete the order is annoying. Ubereats doesn’t do that. Plus I wanna get the order complete and leave not sit there and type in 3 digits than clock complete or take a pic of receipt either. Especially while driving. Time is already sensitive for drivers to get the delivery done to receive the next order. 
Also DoorDash doesn’t let you communicate with customer unless they chat to you first. I was stuck at a gate with no gate code or don’t have enough info to deliver so customer doesn’t chat first unless your close enough to their location. Again time sensitive not enough money for time. 

Ubereats tips should have some mandatory tips. Most my orders are leave at door yet doesn’t matter how fast or well I deliver I’ve had some no tippers. I just find it rude. Especially Walmart and 7/11 orders get no tippers. 

I live in Vegas it’s pretty busy. DoorDash orders come in very slowly. Actually when I do both apps and I choose to do an order on Ubereats than DoorDash wants to give me an order at the same time.
It’s fine sometimes but it’s like I get no orders unless I have an order already on Uber app which is weird. Happens all the time. I’ve even waited 30mins for DD and nothing. But if I just do Uber in 5-10 or 30 mins and take it boom DoorDash gives me an order. 
Ubereats is has more orders and I’m glad I can deny orders that are 12miles for $5 but tips are never guaranteed. And when you do see and order that’s $11 for 5miles it’s not $11. That’s Ubereats estimate with maybe tips. Very misleading.

DoorDash is strict. Can’t cancel too much or it will count against you. Everywhere in my city is construction and 35mph to get to customer. I don’t think DoorDash knows how long it actually takes to get there cuz I keep getting late violations from 10mins - 30mins. 

Oh I don’t know why some restaurant that are closed get orders. App is not friendly when letting them know. If you don’t speak to customer service they will count it against you if you cancel for good reason. 

On daylight savings time Taco Bell closed at 2am but there usually 24hr there system was down too and I had double orders. I select closed on Ubereats and they count it against me even tho I don’t lie. I don’t get paid for it either. Also at the time I didn’t know it’s best for customer to cancel order cuz if I cancel it does to another driver. But no comp for time and pay for a closed restaurant.
Had a $40 order for Wendy’s that’s closed. Even says on window they close at that time. I chat with Ubereats customer  service. No comp for time or miles. Lost $40 and got nothing.

I don’t understand how delivery apps are so low on pay. It’s till a job with no real benefits and it’s contract. It really does take advantage of drivers. You can get more money from a part time job.

Sorry I’m ranting but being new to all of this even reading Reddits of people doing this for awhile will say it’s not worth it much.

Also people tell others to get real jobs but you don’t know where in life they are and maybe they had no choice but to do delivery apps or their trying there best to find a job and not having luck. I’ve heard many customers, staff at restaurants and some drivers say job market has been more difficult. Barely getting interviews no matter how many times you call and show interest. So don’t judge others if they only have this for income.

Uber Eats Scammed Me Out of My $30 Promo Code and Hung Up On Me,"I just had the most frustrating experience with Uber Eats, and I need to vent. Here's what happened:

I had a $30 promo code that I wanted to use. When I tried applying it, the app wasn’t working, so I reached out to customer support. The first agent told me to place the order anyway and reassured me that the promo code was still active. They said I could reach back out after placing the order, and the discount would be applied.

So, trusting them, I went ahead and placed the order. But when I contacted support again, the next agent told me the promo code was deactivated! When I tried explaining what the first agent said, they flat-out refused to help, saying promo codes are ""system generated."" I even asked to escalate the issue, but the agent just ended the chat on me.

I’m now stuck paying the full amount for an order I wouldn’t have placed otherwise. It’s such a shady tactic to get me to spend money. First, they tell me the code is active, and then, after the order is placed, they conveniently say it’s not valid anymore. To make things worse, they hung up on me when I tried to get some accountability.

UberEats Scammed me,"I had a $30 promo code that I wanted to use. When I tried applying it, the app wasn’t working, so I reached out to customer support. The first agent told me to place the order anyway and reassured me that the promo code was still active. They said I could reach back out after placing the order, and the discount would be applied.

So, trusting them, I went ahead and placed the order. But when I contacted support again, the next agent told me the promo code was deactivated! When I tried explaining what the first agent said, they flat-out refused to help, saying promo codes are ""system generated."" I even asked to escalate the issue, but the agent just ended the chat on me.

I’m now stuck paying the full amount for an order I wouldn’t have placed otherwise. It’s such a shady tactic to get me to spend money. First, they tell me the code is active, and then, after the order is placed, they conveniently say it’s not valid anymore. To make things worse, they hung up on me when I tried to get some accountability.

Apple Pay was showing up as a payment method there but it wasn’t actually getting selected even though I was manually selecting it. Both the apps were just showing the corporate card as the only available option that could be used for payment.

"Tipped 25 dollars and paid for priority, STILL they multi apped. ","Like come on , 25 dollar tip on a 45 dollar order means it was 55% of the order, from an ice cream shop 7 minutes away. 

Respectfully I just want to say to the drivers. Please I get it , if you need the money fair enough, but I paid a high as hell tip and priority to avoid this, and you don't HAVE to accept my order. 

So just a word of warning. I will be lowering my tip once I get my food if the temperatures aren't literally perfect ( or in this case with ice cream, not melted at all.) And that's reasonable as I paid exorbitantly for them to NOT drive around with my food once they already picked it up. 

Tldr: don't multi app on a very high tipper and then expect them to not lower their tip. Just because I tip generously doesn't mean I don't get pretty annoyed at people spitting in the face of my generosity. 

Edit: I'm a zoomer, we've failed the word literally, my point was simply ice cream soup isn't all that's neccesary for me to be upset. It being 15% melted also wouldn't be cool considering its 7 mins away and I paid for priority to ensure no stacked orders, and tipped high as hell to prevent a financial need to multiapp to survive.

I cancelled an order literally immediately and was charged for the food. ,I placed an order the other day and it went through without asking me what I wanted to use to pay (or at least I didn't see it) because I didn't realize it was already connected to my venmo and I didn't know I had any money on my venmo(my sister had sent me money as a gift and I didn't know that yet).

UK McDonald’s and deliveries - something has to be done,"I feel as though things have reached a point with McDonald’s and deliveries in the UK where it simply can’t continue.

Missing items, incorrect items, poor quality of items, missing sauces. The list goes on. 

I understand mistakes happen, but as a consumer they make it near on impossible to get compensation for these issues. I had an entire meal missing from an order a few weeks ago and the best Uber could do was offer a refund of £1.80! McDonald’s aren’t interested either when I contacted them.

The real kicker is when you order directly through the official McDonald’s app rather than Uber. There is absolutely no way to report missing items or make a complaint about anything at all. You are instructed to either call your delivery driver (a joke, because they only delivered what they were given) or use the ‘online assistant’ chat bot which ultimately just tells you to call the driver as well!

I did manage to get given an 0800 number which was a dedicated McDonald’s Uber Eats helpline and the lady there promised me she would refund my order within 15 working days. 20 working days came and went. No refund. I ended up doing a chargeback through my bank.

Do not use UberEATS.,"Let me explain. The service is different than it was a year ago.

If you have any issues with your order, your only option for support is text chat with a machine. This often does not understand the issue.

If you resolve it this way and get a refund, you will not get a refund for the full amount you paid. Either the delivery fee, service fee, or tip is retained by Uber.

If you order food and it says ""max delivery time 90min"" you can select priority and it changes to something like ""max delivery time 75min."" However, after you pay, the max delivery time can change to greater than 120min. Meaning if you have a schedule to keep, Uber has fraudulently represented the delivery window. Now you have to spend 30 minutes on text chat and 30 more minutes before you can leave. Costing me an hour is worth more than I paid for the food.

If you get connected to an agent (I encourage everyone to try this), they will simply pretend to not understand you while prividing prepared responses. __They will then simply disconnect the chat__.

This is unreal. Grubhub and doordash are simple, east, and accurate. They provide full refunds, do not hang up on you, and their order delivery estimates do not change after receiving payment.

Cancellation fun,"Is it physically possible to cancel an order within five minutes using the ubereats desktop website if you don't know how to do it beforehand?  This is an honest question.

I just tried to cancel an order 30 seconds or so after having made it.  After using puzzle solving skills and advanced AI to work out how to cancel the order, I finally get to an online chatbot who points out that it took me more than five minutes to cancel my order.  After several attempts I finally manage to talk to a human being.  I point out that I wanted to cancel it after 30 seconds but ubereat's systems took more than 5 minutes to decipher and use and point out that they are intentionally hard to use to the extent that it's unrealistic to expect a regular person who hasn't done it before to be able to cancel an order within five minutes.  I accept the situation and simply ask for instructions on how to cancel an order in the future within five minutes.  The helpdesk guy gives me instructions for the mobile app I believe?  I point out that his instruction don't make sense and that I'm using a desktop computer and ask for instructions on how to cancel an order in the future.  Instead of doing this he transfers me to another team.  In most companies this would mean you're going to speak to someone else immediately.  At ubereats they tell me that this means that they're going to try to respond to me somehow in 6 to 12 hours.

""Message received! We will do our best to respond within 6 to 12 hours.""

I call uber on the phone and it's impossible to get through.  There is no ubereats phone line.  There is only one for uber drivers which physically won't let you get through if you're not registered as a delivery person.

Uber is Scamming Customers: Charged for a Canceled Order and Refuses to Answer Questions ,"I placed an order on Uber and canceled it within less than a minute—yet they still charged me. When I contacted their support team, they completely dodged my questions. I specifically asked if the money would be refunded if the merchant agreed, and they refused to answer. This silence speaks volumes and seems like clear evidence of consumer fraud.

To make it worse, I confirmed with the merchant that they never received any payment from Uber. So where’s my money going? Uber is essentially keeping my money for a service that was never provided, and they’re refusing to justify their actions.

This is not just bad customer service—this feels like a deliberate scam. Under U.S. consumer protection laws, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, this behavior is illegal. I’m planning to file formal complaints with the FTC and my state’s attorney general to address this.

Has anyone else experienced this? This is not just about a refund anymore—this is about holding a giant company accountable for what seems to be outright theft.

Flat rate nightmares (also AVOID walmart orders) ,"Last night I signed up for the flat rate ""opportunity"" of $18.50/hour. Usually, I love these. 

I accepted a delivery from walmart for their black friday deals. I get to walmart, have 2 other deliveries offered from same place, so I accept. 

The wait time to get the packages from walmart is nearly 2 hours. They are slammed and delivery drivers are definitely NOT on their priority list. I've had a few orders get cancelled, and I haven't delivered much yet (started 2 weeks ago) so my cancellation rate is a bit high. I don't want to cancel 3 more deliveries, so I wait. ..and wait. 

FINALLY get the packages, start delivering. Get finished FOUR HOURS after I accept. 

I look at the compensation at it seems.. off. I do the math. (50.23 / 18.50 = 2.7!??) 

So I fire up live chat and am told I was paid corrected ""based on their maximum compensation policies"" 

I send the screen shot for the flat rate opportunity which states online ""flat rate of 18.50/hour for active time, from acceptance to completion"". I point this out and am told that I'm wrong, and he hopes I understand. Anyone seen a maximum compensa

  
... I understand that's wage theft. (and that I live in a state that takes it pretty seriously.. I worked in payroll prior to becoming a stay at home Mom looking for extra Christmas money). 

So I call, and the nice lady that I speak to confirms that I've been paid incorrectly and I'm now on hold to be correctly paid. She then tries to transfer me to the department that can fix it. I'm currently being bounced around on hold. I get transferred again, and again, and again. Still dealing with it.

Question- new driver,"Hey yall I'm a new driver (like 2 weeks new).. couple of questions- 

Are yall seeing Walmart deliveries left right and center bc of the Black Friday deals. It works well during the flat rate delivery periods because the ""sitting and waiting for the order"" times are ridiculous here, at least in Virginia. 

My question is- are we required to cancel after a certain period time? I sat for nearly 2 hours today and got paid for it which is awesome but I don't want to break any rules and get in trouble/banned. 

My other question- bc I got told two opposing answers. Another Walmart order. Someone ordered 4 full sized car tires that thankfully Walmart didn't have in store so they cancelled the order after i got there. I got on chat and was told to cancel the order on my end but it wouldn't change my cancellation %age (a bit high rn bc of not understanding the app at the beginning, like 8-9%) after cancelling it jumped to 11%. I contacted support again and was told that the first rep was full of it, there's no way to ""fix"" the cancellation rate even if it's no fault for your own.

Uber charging after order placed - agents unhelpful and no other way to contact support ,"Does anyone know how to contact someone specific at Uber? 

Long story short, I was charged $0.16 more than what the total showed me, and thought hmm that’s weird. After some digging it turns out the tax went up for no reason. The food, fees, delivery etc didn’t change at all… so why did the tax? No clue 

I re-added my order to the cart and it showed the lower tax amount (exactly $0.16 less than the tax I was charged)

Asked chat support, guy was rude and said my request for a refund is denied and then ended the chat on me (I was not asking for a refund I wanted him to explain the reason). Started another chat, same result. Called them, and the lady on the phone said that the fees change after, but nothing else changed so how did the tax change? She doesn’t have more info. Then she said the fees can change depending on the size of the order.. I’m like what the drivers are weighing the orders before delivering? She doesn’t have more info…

So yeah, all I got was a reference number because apparently all they can do it log the issue and in her words “it’ll get handled”. I asked for an email address, they don’t do emails. I asked for a phone number, they don’t have any other numbers 

Last time I was treated this way (with support ending the chat on me) was when my account was supposedly locked due to fraud (because i refunded a lot apparently? - all legit reasons by the way… missing this or incorrect that) 

Honestly I’m so tired of this, I miss the old Uber where every issue was handled by a real person in real time and was vetted there and then. None of this automated refund nonsense that then flags your account and puts it on hold without ANY communication 

Oh well,

A system error randomly charged me 50€ and support is unable to trace it,"Hello everyone,



I'm reaching out here as the last resort because the Uber Eats support team has been unhelpful to help resolve this issue: Last week, I placed a grocery order through Uber Eats valued at **32€.** However, I was charged over **50€** on my bank statement, which seems to be due to a system error. Unfortunately, I didn't notice this overcharge at the time. Two days later, I was charged again, but this time the correct amount of **32€**.



After noticing the second charge, I contacted Uber Eats support. They told me everything seemed ok from their side and suggested me to speak with my bank, and my bank advised me to cancel my card. Digging deeper, I realized that the **50€** charge doesn't match any order details in the app, but the timestamp aligns perfectly with my order time. Same hour and same exact minute.



I've reached out to Uber support multiple times, but they seem confused and haven't been able to resolve the issue. They say they cannot understand my problem, they say that the system tells the charges are legit and after two days of trying to get this situation figured out they locked the ticket and stopped responding. If the **50€** charge happened at the exact same time I made my order it's obvious that it was Uber Eats.



Has anyone experienced something similar? Is there anything more I can do to get this resolved?

I Canceled My Uber Eats Membership After Two Horrifying Experiences,"I’ve officially canceled my Uber Eats membership, and I won’t be ordering from them again.

I used to love using Uber Eats and found the monthly membership worthwhile. Most of the time, my orders went smoothly, and when there were issues, getting a refund was easy.

However, about a month and a half ago, I had a horrific experience. I ordered a breakfast quesadilla, and as I bit into it, I realized the bacon was undercooked and tasted off. I switched to my side of sweet potatoes, only to find what seemed to be a dead maggot in them! I was absolutely mortified and sick to my stomach. After getting off the phone with customer service, I ended up vomiting quite a bit.

After receiving my order, I immediately contacted Uber Eats to report the issue and request a refund. They told me my complaint would be sent to a specialized team for review, so I expected a full refund, especially since I couldn’t eat the food and ended up feeling ill. I sent them pictures of the undercooked bacon and the maggot-infested potatoes, which I’ll probably post below. However, after two weeks without a response, I contacted them again, and they said they would notify the specialized team. When they finally got in touch with me, they told me that I didn’t qualify for a refund!

When I pressed for an explanation, repeatedly asking, “What is the reason?!” they claimed I waited too long to complain. I reminded them that I had reached out within about half an hour of receiving my order, and their slow response was the real issue. In the end, they refused to give me a refund, which left me furious. If undercooked bacon and maggots don’t qualify for a refund, then what does?

I still didn’t cancel my membership right away, but a week ago, I placed another order that included a rotisserie chicken. When I opened it, it smelled rancid, and part of it was missing. I tried a small piece, and it was completely rotten! I literally couldn’t get that rotten corpse taste out of my mouth for the rest of the day, no matter what I did. I ended up throwing the whole thing away. Once again, when I reached out to customer service, they said I didn’t qualify for a refund.

So, I finally canceled my membership. If rotten food and uncooked items aren’t grounds for a refund, then what is? Has anyone else faced similar issues with Uber Eats? It feels like they’re just stealing money from us. I didn’t even contact the restaurant because I believe Uber Eats is responsible for the quality of the food they deliver since they are the ones taking my money.",,,UberEATS,4,1,1.0,Public-Catch-8429,y,1,1,,,cancel uber eats membership two horrifying experience,ive officially cancel uber eats membership wont order use love use uber eats find monthly membership worthwhile time order go smoothly issue get refund easy however month half ago horrific experience order breakfast quesadilla bit realize bacon undercooked taste switch side sweet potato find seem dead maggot absolutely mortify sick stomach get phone customer service end vomit quite bit receive order immediately contact uber eats report issue request refund tell complaint would send specialized team review expect full refund especially since couldnt eat food end feel ill send picture undercooked bacon maggotinfested potato ill probably post however two week without response contact say would notify specialized team finally get touch tell didnt qualify refund press explanation repeatedly ask reason claim wait long complain remind reach within half hour receive order slow response real issue end refuse give refund leave furious undercooked bacon maggot dont qualify refund still didnt cancel membership right away week ago place another order include rotisserie chicken open smell rancid part miss try small piece completely rotten literally couldnt get rotten corpse taste mouth rest day matter end throw whole thing away reach customer service say didnt qualify refund finally cancel membership rotten food uncooked item arent ground refund anyone else face similar issue uber eats feel like theyre steal money u didnt even contact restaurant believe uber eats responsible quality food deliver since one take money,0,0,cancel uber eats membership two horrifying experience ive officially cancel uber eats membership wont order use love use uber eats find monthly membership worthwhile time order go smoothly issue get refund easy however month half ago horrific experience order breakfast quesadilla bit realize bacon undercooked taste switch side sweet potato find seem dead maggot absolutely mortify sick stomach get phone customer service end vomit quite bit receive order immediately contact uber eats report issue request refund tell complaint would send specialized team review expect full refund especially since couldnt eat food end feel ill send picture undercooked bacon maggotinfested potato ill probably post however two week without response contact say would notify specialized team finally get touch tell didnt qualify refund press explanation repeatedly ask reason claim wait long complain remind reach within half hour receive order slow response real issue end refuse give refund leave furious undercooked bacon maggot dont qualify refund still didnt cancel membership right away week ago place another order include rotisserie chicken open smell rancid part miss try small piece completely rotten literally couldnt get rotten corpse taste mouth rest day matter end throw whole thing away reach customer service say didnt qualify refund finally cancel membership rotten food uncooked item arent ground refund anyone else face similar issue uber eats feel like theyre steal money u didnt even contact restaurant believe uber eats responsible quality food deliver since one take money,7,230,"{'neg': 0.533, 'neu': 0.467, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.6908}","{'neg': 0.209, 'neu': 0.719, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.99}",0.0,0.533,0.467,-0.6908,0.072,0.209,0.719,-0.99,1

Honest drivers versus thieves versus cancellation rate,"I'll keep it short and sweet. 

After my fourth failed McDonald's pickup this week, due to a driver steeling the food, a conversation with technical support explained to me the following...

They have received hundreds of complaints from drivers about stolen deliveries. 

Cancellation Rate is increased every single time a driver cancels an order or every single time a customer cancels their delivery request. 

On Friday last week, and for most of this year, my cancellation was 1%. Right now, it's sitting at 4% because of thieves.

The solution is simple. 

Anytime an order is stolen and a second or third driver is sent to the restaurant to pick it up. Because the restaurant will refuse to make another of the same order for the same customer, if the driver contacts the customer to verify they have not received their delivery, the driver should have an option in the menu to resubmit the pickup so that the restaurant will be forced to remake the food. Then that same driver can turn around and pick up that order and deliver it. That way the, the honest drivers are not penalized for a thief's actions. The current system is set up to cancel the order and add to that honest driver 's cancellation rate. The customer is disappointed and can complain and a driver is frustrated with having lost the tip and the income and the fuel to get to that restaurant.",deliver,,UberEATS,32,1,0.54,Xo-Mo,n,1,1,,,honest driver versus thief versus cancellation rate,ill keep short sweet fourth failed mcdonalds pickup week due driver steel food conversation technical support explain follow receive hundred complaint driver steal delivery cancellation rate increase every single time driver cancel order every single time customer cancel delivery request friday last week year cancellation right sitting thief solution simple anytime order steal second third driver send restaurant pick restaurant refuse make another order customer driver contact customer verify receive delivery driver option menu resubmit pickup restaurant force remake food driver turn around pick order deliver way honest driver penalize thiefs action current system set cancel order add honest driver cancellation rate customer disappointed complain driver frustrate lose tip income fuel get restaurant,0,0,honest driver versus thief versus cancellation rate ill keep short sweet fourth failed mcdonalds pickup week due driver steel food conversation technical support explain follow receive hundred complaint driver steal delivery cancellation rate increase every single time driver cancel order every single time customer cancel delivery request friday last week year cancellation right sitting thief solution simple anytime order steal second third driver send restaurant pick restaurant refuse make another order customer driver contact customer verify receive delivery driver option menu resubmit pickup restaurant force remake food driver turn around pick order deliver way honest driver penalize thiefs action current system set cancel order add honest driver cancellation rate customer disappointed complain driver frustrate lose tip income fuel get restaurant,7,113,"{'neg': 0.291, 'neu': 0.427, 'pos': 0.282, 'compound': -0.0258}","{'neg': 0.255, 'neu': 0.631, 'pos': 0.115, 'compound': -0.9565}",0.282,0.291,0.427,-0.0258,0.115,0.255,0.631,-0.9565,0

Extremely strange occurrence while doing Uber eats today,"
I got an order for someone at a restaurant. In the order notes it said to call a number for customer support. 

The restaurant had no history of the order so I call the number that the customer listed (stupid mistake, I was just on auto pilot) and it’s an automated voicemail for an ISP. Now I’m thinking, “did someone just get my phone number?” 

I contact Uber support but am on hold for 15 minutes. 

While waiting, I received another order. This order has the exact same instructions saying to call the SAME number that the first one had listed. 

I haven’t done Uber in forever so I’m thinking it’s some sort of glitch or something. 

I get a voicemail from the second customer saying that they have been waiting 2 hours for their order. I check with the restaurant and they never received an order from the second person either. 

I end up giving up on waiting for Uber support, cancel the orders, and end up calling Uber support to find out what happened later on. 

I explained the situation to FOUR different Uber reps on the phone. The first one says they are going to document it, escalate it, investigate, etc. 

The second has me repeat the entire story to them again and doesn’t show a record of documentation. She puts me on hold while she figures out what to do. 

After waiting on hold for 5 minutes, the call goes through and someone else picks up. They have no idea who I am or my situation so I explain it a third time and they let me know that they need to transfer me again because they can’t verify the order details. 

The fourth person is able to verify on their end that sure enough, the same phone number was used in customer instructions. They also let me know that the order was placed BY the restaurant. 

By the restaurant…

But they don’t have the order on their end… 

The Uber rep agrees that the situation is weird and promises to escalate, investigate, document, etc. 

After we hang up, I get a standard notification from Uber that my phone conversation was resolved. 

At this point, I’m thinking that Uber doesn’t want to document it and investigate it because of liability. 

Now I’m thinking to myself… was this some sort of elaborate fishing scheme? Was the restaurant hacked?

What to do if there’s a sketchy driver?,"I know this will sound super judgy but I’m paranoid. So I don’t necessarily have a mansion or anything but my house isn’t too bad, it’s not that big but it’s got a drive way of cars usually 3. I drive but sometimes I order off Uber eats because I’m sick or lazy, yes I admit I can be lazy and just order it. It’s usually when I get deals too. I keep getting 8 dollars off so why wouldn’t I use it? 

Anyways, my paranoid thoughts relate to the cars. They aren’t necessarily Porsches or BMWs but they still are looked after and are just normal cars. I’m paranoid the person will see the cars and will try to steal them or break into my house one day. 

1 car is my sisters and the other is my dads and the other is mine. Today a guy dressed in black with a cap covering his face delivered my food and was looking around my house and the cars as he was leaving. What do I do if something sketchy happens?

Did not receive my prop 22 payment. How come?,I started up doing deliveries again about two weeks ago. This whole time I’ve been doing a lot of deliveries that are long but do not pay very well since there isn’t an abundance of trips right now. I even did a grocery store delivery delivery that paid like 11 dollars. So I feel pretty confident that I should receive something in prop 22. When it hit last Wednesday I didn’t receive anything. I just assumed that it was the next Wednesday that they give payments. But today I check and nothing. Is it something I’m not seeing or am I just not getting my prop 22.

"Driver switched my meat order for reduced for quick sale items and tried to remove the stickers, but missed one... Is this allowed? ","Just as my title says. I put in a small grocery order for delivery from Fresh Co. here in Canada, and I ordered two packages of fresh chicken breast. I chose specific items as replacement if they weren't available, but the delivery person did not swap them, and did not message me about the items. I tipped the driver $25 on an $80 order because I felt bad because I added milk to the order after he was already halfway done shopping, and I texted him to apologize about adding the milk in case it caused him any inconvenience, and I made sure I tipped accordingly.  While unpacking the bags just now I pulled out the chicken, and noticed on both packages that there was part of a yellow sticker on each that said ""SAVE NOW! REDUCED FOR QUICK SALE"",with the part of the sticker that the cashier takes removed for them to take. I shop there all the time and I know those stickers are for $3 off each package. The best before date on these items in TOMORROW, and I was still charged the full price. I've never had this happen before, so my question is if this is allowed? If this is still they are allowed to just do any time I will never order from UE again because that's INSANE, but if it's not allowed I need to know right away so I can adjust the guys tip because to me this 100% feels like he tried to scam me for six freaking dollars, and I'm definitely not tipping him $25, or anything if he is scamming me. I've never had an issue like this, so I wanted to ask here before messaging Uber directly and before penalizing the driver if it is something they are allowed to do.
Thanks to any and all who reply and help.
Cheers!

Edit: To clarify, because a commenter thought I was saying the driver scammed me for coupons, that's not the case. I called the store to verify if there was or wasn't any of the fresh, not reduced packages of the chicken I ordered, and the mane said, and I quote, ""Oh yeah, there are TONS out here. I count at least 11 in the display, and there are no reduced ones left at all."", so the driver specifically chose the reduced, expiring tomorrow chicken which I also confirmed with the store were $3 off each package.

Do they think I’m a driver when I order pickup? ,"I was wondering if it common for other customers using pickup to be treated poorly or to be asked for verification because they think you’re a driver not a customer.

I’m an ubereats customer (I even pay for Uberone) and I often order food on the app because of the offers and deals, and I will still pick it up myself. In all my time of doing this I’ve never been asked to verify myself to a restaurant worker. However I can tell sometimes they think I’m a driver because they see “ubereats” so they don’t give me the same level of service as a customer.
Anyways today the drive-thru worker asked my name at the speaker, again at the window and then asked to see my verification. I don’t have a common name (99th percentile I just looked it up) so if I was guessing a random name to steal food I would be very lucky. He then stared me down until I drove away and even stuck his head out the window to watch me for a bit for some reason.

Cancelation rate increasing when reporting stolen orders. IS THIS LEGAL????,"Hello, I'm a diamond driver who has always had a 0% cancelation rate. Since about 3 months ago, evertytime the restaurant is closed, or the order is stolen by someone else, if i report it as stolen to customer service it affects my cancelation rate. 

I escalated the issue to a supervisor multiple times, they told me two things that shocked me.

One, yes, all cancellations that are done by anyone but the customer or restaurant affect your cancelation rating. Customers and restaurants refuse to cancel because they lose money.

Two, if your cancelation rate is over 20%, you will be deactivated.

So, if 20 of your last 100 trips are stolen, or the restaurant is closed, or the order will take 30+ minutes and you don't want to wait, if you cancel in any of these circumstances *you* as the driver will be deactivated 

This is what I'm not understanding correctly. Isn't that illegal? You cannot fire me, or tear up a contractual agreement with me because you hired idiots that steal orders? Or partner with restaurants that are too incompetent to confirm the pickup? How is that my problem? 

That is *not* grounds for termination of contract. Does anyone know the legality around this?

Is this a TikTok trend?!,"I received an email like this a week ago, for an Uber Connect order. Uber threatened me with my job if I didn’t deliver the order…. Which I had. I have all the details and then their chat bots supposedly copied and pasted a reply from their customer stating it was their fault, not mine. Uber then sent a follow up email basically saying “don’t let this happen again”….. Now, I have yet another of these emails. Called support, they claim it’s not a mark on my account, but once again threaten me with my job. Outrageous!

This is exactly why here in New Zealand, the employment court and court of appeal have deemed us to be employees. Uber is now going to the Supreme Court….. and they will be dismissed. Uber claims they are just the payment collection and platform between drivers and customers. Yet, they have all the control. If you were a self employed, independent contractor like Uber claims, they wouldn’t get involved. The dispute would be between you and YOUR customer. But these aren’t our customers, they are Ubers.

One Week Left to Deadline for Uber’s $200M Investor Settlement,"Hey everyone, any $UBER investors here? If you missed it, Uber has agreed to pay a $200M settlement to investors over claims related to its IPO, including financial losses, issues with local regulations, and safety concerns.

Here’s a quick recap: In 2019, Uber went public and raised over $8.1 billion. But, by August of that year, the company’s revenue increased only by 2%, while expenses rose by $507M. This news caused a significant drop of over 20% in $UBER shares, and investors filed a lawsuit shortly after.

Now, Uber has agreed to pay $200M to resolve these claims. The deadline to submit your claim is coming up on November 20, 2024, so if you were hit back then, make sure to check the details and file for your [payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/uber-investor-settlement).

Protip: Putting a cold thing in a bag with warm food makes it cold food.,"I don't know if this is a driver trend or a restaurant trend, but I've been seeing it lately any time I've ordered a cold 20 oz drink in a bottle instead of a fountain drink it gets thrown in the same bag as the warm food. 

I don't know if it's a driver laziness so they don't have to carry it, or a restaurant making sure 'the drink doesn't get forgotten' and I don't know how to complain about it. 

Do I thumbs down the restaurant? 

Do I thumbs down the driver for bringing it to me like that? 

Do I leave a note that just says ""Do not put cold drink in bag with food"" (I'm assuming from what I've read that they won't take it out for food safety reasons, and don't even see it until dropping off the order anyways)

I know a shout in the void of reddit doesn't really accomplish any change, but I am trying to understand it better. 

Thank you.

**Edit:**  Thanks everyone. I 100% understand it's a restaurant thing. I gave the restaurant 1* chose poorly packed, and put my comments about cold drinks in a warm bag.

I asked if it was the driver cause it was an order where the item was in a bag and the bag was knotted. I was unsure if this was a driver wanted to carry less and put it in the bag and tied a knot in the bag afterwards. There were no safety seals (This seems to be a restaurant thing as the item labels weren't sealing the container shut either. 

I don't usually request these types of drinks, but it was 8:30 at night and I hadn't eaten dinner and just literally wanted some Orange Chicken from Panda, and if I spent $1 more I would hit free delivery so it was cheaper to get the drink than not. They had a $1 for a drink deal at the time. I had plenty of drinks in the fridge and normally don't order them, but I guess a free item means cold food. I used to order water bottle from Canes, but they'd also put it in the bag, so I wound up just ordering a fountain drink instead and poured it out since I was trying to avoid soda. I didn't think this would be the case everywhere. 

I gave the driver a thumbs up and they got a $4.37 tip on a $15 order ($17 because the drink was $3 without the deal to get it for $1).

"UberEats driver unreachable via phone, did not deliver food, no refund","My address and phone number were correct, I ordered another meal and this was properly delivered by the next driver with no issue within the proper timeframe. 

The previous driver, had issues getting to the correct address because it seems he kept trying to get close to ME as indicated on the GPS of the app as opposed to the address I had given, which was a few hundred meters away. I kept trying to tell him to just go to the address indicated, but he wouldn’t listen. There was also a language barrier.

I, then, tried to call him but stumbled across someone who had no idea what I was talking about. Turns out he gave his SIM-card to a friend and he said so in the chat. 

He eventually left with the food, but marked it as delivered, even though he didn’t get the pin needed. 

UberEats won’t refund me because we exchanged chats and he waited the 8 minutes. They also told me to verify MY phone number and address. Even though the guy was not at the correct address and admitted in the chat that the phone number he gave was unreachable. What can I do?

ETA: They kept giving me the same generic answer so I then asked for the chat history to ask for a charge back from my bank and I said I was going to cancel my Premium account.

Ffffffffffffffkkkkkkkk UberEats,"Basically this. 

I've had to make 5 calls today for an issue from last night and they keep saying ""we'll escalate it"", but the emails I receive never address the entire situation (or address the wrong things entirely). When I try to reply, it says I'm using a different email address (but I'm *replying* directly from ***their*** email!). It's the same email attached to my login.

I also tried to tell them that as a customer, I think some of the rules they've put on drivers are unfair (like the new cancelation thing), and they straight up said ""you're not a driver so we don't care"". 

If I didn't receive the service for ""free"" (included with instacart), I wouldn't use it at all. 

I've never had this many problems with any of the other services. And I know the same people drive for most of them, where I live, so it's gotta be how the different apps/brand work. 

---

My driver last night was not one of my personal regulars, though, and he seemed to be the scammy type - picture and name didn't match (I tried saying ""thank you [name from screen]!"" when it was finally delivered, and they said ""who's [name]?"", so, yeah). Car was different color and type altogether (it was a sedan, supposed to be an SUV). Didn't even pick my order up until 10 minutes after the latest possible expected delivery time, and it was Taco Bell. What I received was food that had been sitting for an hour, hard beans, room temp sour cream. The tamper sticker seemed to have been peeled up and I was missing two items. I always tip a minimum of two gallons worth of gas, and then increase based on time of day, how busy it is, etc. It was later on a Saturday evening, so my tip was 25% of the order total. I've never removed or lowered a tip for any reason, and I'm not starting now. Technically the job was mostly done and I know they don't pay y'all.

If I leave a negative review will the delivery person see it? ,"So I live in a college dorm building and I put in the notes to leave at my door and if they can leave it at the back of the building instead of the front because my room is closest. Every driver understands that and I haven’t had any issues. Today I was feeling really sick and placed an order. The driver texts me that they can’t find the door but are at the building. So I respond where the back door is but if they still can’t find it they can just leave it at wherever and I can find it, no big deal. A few minutes later I get an app notification that says my order will be cancelled if I don’t respond. I then texted the driver asking if I need to meet them and they say yes. At this point Im frustrated but figured they might be confused and are at another building. I go to the front door and the driver is standing outside the door and then they tell me they couldn’t get inside to deliver it because you need a fob to get inside the dorms. I just find it frustrating because they are at the correct building and I find it odd that the driver was trying to get INSIDE a building when I asked to just leave it at the door. I have never gave a negative review but this situation was just frustrating and I think I should. If I did would it be anonymous? Or should I just let jt pass?

Uber driver sat in his car for 5 minutes and the. got upset with me that he had to wait,"So I live in an apartment in a house which is split into 10 flats but from the outside it looks any normal house

Because of this I have to leave my flat and go downstairs to the door to collect orders. This is fine and I always select meet at door for my orders

I have had some phone provider issues today because they are doing work in my area so taking calls (not coming through sometimes) has been a problem. So i left a note for my driver saying not ring me and I would keep an eye out and be at the door ready for them and if I wasn’t then he should ring the door bell for my flat 

So I watch and I see their car arrive on the app. I quickly put on my dressing gown and rush downstairs and open the front door to the building

I stand there for maybe 2 minutes and begin to wonder where they are. This happens sometimes where the app will show them arriving when they are actually still at the top of the road or something 

In my slippers I make my way to the front of the garden and peer out at the street to make sure they aren’t lost trying to find the right house. There are a fair amount of cars  and I don’t immediately see anyone

I look around and wait again for couple of minutes and begin wondering if perhaps my order has been stolen or they have gone to the wrong building ( this has happened before)

Then I finally spot about 6 houses down there is a car with its rear lights on. Again in my slippers I walk down the road and as I get closer I see a man sat on his phone who spots me in the side mirror walking down with my phone and waves. I wave back and he gets out and says ‘hi’ and goes to get the food out from the back seat

I say hi back and smile as I’m not overly bothered about the situation. As he gets his food out he starts ranting ‘I’ve been sat here for 5 minutes now trying to ring’. I pointed out the note and that the order said to meet at door but he just ignored me and got back in his car and drove off

I have noticed a few times before that drivers will ring me and say ‘I’m here’ and I will say that I’m coming down stairs and when I get to my front door they are still sat in their car on the other side of the road and only start to move once they see me open the door ",customer,Delivery,UberEATS,4,1,0.6,Last_Revenue2718,n,1,1,,,uber driver sit car minute got upset wait,live apartment house split flat outside look normal house leave flat go downstairs door collect order fine always select meet door order phone provider issue today work area take call come sometimes problem leave note driver say ring would keep eye door ready wasnt ring door bell flat watch see car arrive app quickly put dress gown rush downstairs open front door building stand maybe minute begin wonder happen sometimes app show arrive actually still top road something slipper make way front garden peer street make sure arent lose try find right house fair amount car dont immediately see anyone look around wait couple minute begin wonder perhaps order steal go wrong building happen finally spot house car rear light slipper walk road get closer see man sit phone spot side mirror walk phone wave wave back get say hi go get food back seat say hi back smile im overly bother situation get food start rant ive sit minute try ring point note order say meet door ignore get back car drive notice time driver ring say im say im come stair get front door still sit car side road start move see open door,0,0,uber driver sit car minute got upset wait live apartment house split flat outside look normal house leave flat go downstairs door collect order fine always select meet door order phone provider issue today work area take call come sometimes problem leave note driver say ring would keep eye door ready wasnt ring door bell flat watch see car arrive app quickly put dress gown rush downstairs open front door building stand maybe minute begin wonder happen sometimes app show arrive actually still top road something slipper make way front garden peer street make sure arent lose try find right house fair amount car dont immediately see anyone look around wait couple minute begin wonder perhaps order steal go wrong building happen finally spot house car rear light slipper walk road get closer see man sit phone spot side mirror walk phone wave wave back get say hi go get food back seat say hi back smile im overly bother situation get food start rant ive sit minute try ring point note order say meet door ignore get back car drive notice time driver ring say im say im come stair get front door still sit car side road start move see open door,8,196,"{'neg': 0.271, 'neu': 0.729, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3818}","{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.841, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.501}",0.0,0.271,0.729,-0.3818,0.072,0.087,0.841,-0.501,0

does anyone ever appeal to cancellation rate? If so what are your results?,"Fairly new to UE, have about 100 orders barely, however this week my cancellation rate went up to 3% for reasons out of my control.

1st order: jack in the box said there system was down & wasn’t taking any orders. Spoke to support & was told I have to be the one to cancel it but since the restaurant isn’t taking the order that my rate would not be affected, it was.

2nd order: another driver took the food & mcdonalds said I’d have to call support and have them cancel for me (they did) & my rate was also affected

3rd order: sonic was closed so I did support via chat to cancel due to restaurant being closed and my rate went up 

For the first two orders when speaking to support I specifically asked if my rate would be affected and they said no. I understand each call is recorded + notes made per call. I reached out to support to have rate adjusted since none were my fault and they said “we know it’s not fair but that’s just how it is since the software automatically adds it to your account” to which they explained the policy for when it wont affect my rate:
-restaurant being closed
-restaurant unable to fulfill orders
-or customer cancelling order

I asked this to be escalated to supervisor (advice from a support agent since they stated they can manually adjust account) and they pretty much said rate won’t be affected for reasons stated above & don’t have the power to adjust rate as well as telling me “don’t go online if you can’t deliver”. After 15 minutes they said they have a specialist that can adjust but only after investigating reasons for cancelled orders.

However, during the day, usually around 2pm, a bunch of uber delivery men drop off orders of one sauce, one can of drink or one banana. No one from my building actually orders these things. Sometimes there are over 20 of these single sauce orders that get dropped off at the building every afternoon.

Its really weird, and I am trying to figure out why / who is making these orders. Surely the restaurants who put these orders through think something is up? Is it a way for the uber drivers to earn rewards when times are quiet? Its super annoying and causes a lot of littering. I wonder if anyone knows if this is a common thing or whats going on...

Just had a 1 hour long heated debate with my friend about tipping etiquette in a gig economy,"I did Uber Eats years ago, before I got into my new profession, and was always of the mindset that 'tipping is not obligatory, but is always appreciated' whenever I was doing my deliveries. That way, I was never disappointed and always knew how much money to expect to make based off the set rates for distance... 

Now that I'm working and making better money, I always tip $3 minimum because I know what a pain in the ass it is to go up 5 flights of stairs when an elevator is out and the person should realistically just meet you in the lobby to be fair. Anyway, my friend has been too lazy for the last week or so and has been ordering delivery constantly, apparently, and since we were hanging out tonight, he ordered for us tonight. I told him, add a $3 tip on for me and I'll give him the change later, and he scoffed, saying how he doesn't tip and me doing so was stupid. 

Basically, his mentality is that of many... Uber adds on multiple fees, so therefore, he shouldn't have to tip his driver, who makes $3 because it isn't his problem or his responsibility to pay Uber's employees a living wage, yet, he'll order twice a day for a week or better. I understand, tips add up, but he obviously isn't hurting, if he can afford to order $650 worth of food in a week... I was just like, what is $1? I tried to explain to him, that many people use delivery services because they're elderly, disabled, or new moms home with a child and that they're dependent on them, so yes, a driver should get a tip, just like a waitress or a bartender because I see them delivering huge grocery orders and if the person ordering is part of Uber Eats+, DoorDash Premium, etc that they aren't getting that $7-$10 delivery fee... This still didn't register with him and his argument was that, it's the stockholders getting rich off the fees, to which I just replied, yes because they're the ones that invest and gave loans to the company and the company should get the majority of the rest of the money because they carry the risk... That is how Capitalism works.

I had hoped that explaining this to him would make him see the light, but no, of course not... He just doubled down and I'm like, well, when they eventually stop taking your order because you're such a cheap f#ck, enjoy having to get up off your fat ass in -18C weather to go out and walk 20 minutes to get your midnight McDonalds.",deliver,Tip,UberEATS,36,2,0.54,Anonymous,n,1,0,,,hour long heated debate friend tip etiquette gig economy,uber eats year ago get new profession always mindset tip obligatory always appreciate whenever delivery way never disappoint always know much money expect make base set rate distance im work make good money always tip minimum know pain as go flight stair elevator person realistically meet lobby fair anyway friend lazy last week order delivery constantly apparently since hang tonight order u tonight tell add tip ill give change later scoff say doesnt tip stupid basically mentality many uber add multiple fee therefore shouldnt tip driver make isnt problem responsibility pay ubers employee living wage yet hell order twice day week good understand tip add obviously isnt hurt afford order worth food week like try explain many people use delivery service theyre elderly disable new mom home child theyre dependent yes driver get tip like waitress bartender see deliver huge grocery order person order part uber eats doordash premium etc arent get delivery fee still didnt register argument stockholder get rich fee reply yes theyre one invest give loan company company get majority rest money carry risk capitalism work hop explain would make see light course double im like well eventually stop take order youre cheap fck enjoy get fat as c weather go walk minute get midnight mcdonalds,0,0,hour long heated debate friend tip etiquette gig economy uber eats year ago get new profession always mindset tip obligatory always appreciate whenever delivery way never disappoint always know much money expect make base set rate distance im work make good money always tip minimum know pain as go flight stair elevator person realistically meet lobby fair anyway friend lazy last week order delivery constantly apparently since hang tonight order u tonight tell add tip ill give change later scoff say doesnt tip stupid basically mentality many uber add multiple fee therefore shouldnt tip driver make isnt problem responsibility pay ubers employee living wage yet hell order twice day week good understand tip add obviously isnt hurt afford order worth food week like try explain many people use delivery service theyre elderly disable new mom home child theyre dependent yes driver get tip like waitress bartender see deliver huge grocery order person order part uber eats doordash premium etc arent get delivery fee still didnt register argument stockholder get rich fee reply yes theyre one invest give loan company company get majority rest money carry risk capitalism work hop explain would make see light course double im like well eventually stop take order youre cheap fck enjoy get fat as c weather go walk minute get midnight mcdonalds,9,209,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.714, 'pos': 0.286, 'compound': 0.4939}","{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.713, 'pos': 0.217, 'compound': 0.9835}",0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4939,0.217,0.07,0.713,0.9835,0

McDonalds and Uber Eats Theft Or Fraud Loop Hole?,"So, I just placed an order, 6:30PM PST through the McDonalds app to have some nuggets and spicy chicken sandwich delivered. My order delivery estimate was going to be 6:50PM to 6:55PM PST.

The Uber Eats driver assigned to my order called me and informed me that someone had already picked up my order. He then put the McDonalds manager on the phone and he said 2 people before him had the same order ID and information and that the real UberEats delivery driver was the 3rd person attempting to pick up my order. And they would not make a new order for him. They thought he was lying or I was trying to cause some fraud. The real Uber Eats driver said he would cancel on his side and that I should contact UberEats Customer Service to explain the issue as well.

I quickly called UberEats and informed them of the situation. They cancelled my order and refunded me my money.

So it appears there is some sort of fraud or theft happening between the McDonalds app and Uber Eats.

My guess is that they thought they could swipe my food and my tip ($20).

I now remember why I stopped using the McDonalds application and deleted the UberEats app as well.

Hi XXXXX,
My name is Ravali, and I am with the Priority Support team. I am following up on your Better Business Bureau escalation (Complaint ID #22484624).
We’re sorry to hear about your experience with order# 40E2D. I’ve arranged a refund for your order, which should be returned to your account typically within 3-5 business days.
We have processes in place to review this type of feedback with delivery partners, so your concern hasn’t gone unnoticed.
Further regarding the in-app pricing, I'd like to inform you that when you order through our app, the in-app prices may be different than in-store prices. You can see the in-app prices when you build your order for Pickup or Delivery, and these prices may not match the prices on a printed label or printed receipt included by the store with the order.
We appreciate your understanding and we hope to offer you a better experience on your next order.
Thank you for bringing this to our notice and helping us maintain the quality of the Uber experience.
Please let us know if there is anything further we can help with by responding directly to the message thread in-app.""

A restaurant being closed or another driver picking up an order now affects our cancelation rate.," I had gone to pick up an order, and the restaurant said that 4 or 5 delivery drivers have already come by to pick up the same order, and the order isn't there. I called Uber support to let them know that the order had already been picked up so they could cancel it on their end. The representative told me that  I could just cancel it on my end. I asked if it would affect my cancelation rate, and she said only a little bit. I told her as far as I know, when someone has already picked up an order or if the restaurant is closed, Uber support can cancel it on there end so it doesn't affect our cancelation rate and we get compensated for driving to the location to pick up the order.  She pretty much avoided what I was asking and kept telling me I just need to do more deliveries to bring the percentage down. 

Anyway, I ended up calling again to speak with someone else. The 2nd representative was really nice. He said he also thinks it's not fair for the drivers to cancel an order that isn't available to be picked up. However, those are the new guidelines, and it's out of their control.

So, moving forward, we have to be the ones to call the customer and have them cancel their order so it doesn't affect our rates.

Restaurant was closed for refurbishment. Refund refused.,"While helping someone move house, we ordered from a Kaspa's restaurant at about 2pm, by 4pm the order was showing as delivered - but there was no sign of it. 

I tried calling the restaurant and there was no answer. Google says it's temporarily closed. Their national website says it temporarily closed. UE is still taking orders. We go for a bit of a drive after 5pm - yep, it's definitely closed. Nothing is being delivered from there for a while. 

We send photos and screenshots to UE, but they have refused a refund because of a previous refunded order (yeah, our local KFC is the worst).

Despite reminding them of their legal obligations to actually provide a service or a refund, apparently *their decision is final*. Seemingly, UK law does not apply to Uber Eats. And they don't seem keen on providing a UK phone number or postal address either, which makes it difficult to challenge Uber Eats any further.

I fantasised about starting a small claims court claim, winning, and eventually getting bailiffs to go and collect goods from their offices. But once I calmed down, I concluded that a bank chargeback would have to suffice.

How I know it’s not the drivers stealing food ,"When I first started this gig pretty much every restaurant left the food out for us to pick up. Now the only ones left who do are digital kitchens. These are places the average person wouldn’t know it existed unless they were a driver.  Only people in and out of there are drivers and I’ve never showed up to a stolen order there.  

Yet the restaurants where most ‘driver theft’ seems to happen is cheap fast food places.  We pick up from nice restaurants all the time. Why would we steal $10 worth of Wendy’s?  

Another clue it’s not the drivers is the evolution of the interaction with these restaurants and fast food places.  After they started putting behind counter they eliminated any random opportunists taking the food.  They started asking us for names to verify and all was good for 6 months or so.  Then all of a sudden stolen orders start happening again and the restaurants start asking us to show our phones. Now why would the name not be good enough for the restaurant.  Because there is another person out there that knows the name - the customer. 

IMO most stolen orders come from 1 of 3 things. 

1) customer orders what he wants. picks it up himself and claims refund from uber when it’s not delivered. 

2) restaurant worker messes up in some way.  Hands order to wrong driver and gets delivered to wrong person (kind of on driver too but not malicious theft either).  Forgets to make it.  Something… they won’t admit fault because these are mostly younger people working these places not wanting to get in trouble. 

3) some technical difficulty the order is never made. Shift change or role change in restaurant.  New person has no clue why they don’t have it and assumes another driver took it. Since that’s the trope on social media 

I’d say the 4th likelihood scenario is a driver took it.   Maybe has decided to quit. Doesn’t care about deactivation anymore and says F it and take dinner home with him on his last day. But we’re not taking Wendy’s trust me. They’re taking some steaks home with them the last day ",customer,Bad practice,UberEATS,48,6,0.57,Antique-Yak-7169,n,1,1,,,know driver steal food,first start gig pretty much every restaurant leave food u pick one leave digital kitchen place average person wouldnt know exist unless driver people driver ive never show steal order yet restaurant driver theft seem happen cheap fast food place pick nice restaurant time would steal worth wendys another clue driver evolution interaction restaurant fast food place start put behind counter eliminate random opportunist take food start ask u name verify good month sudden stolen order start happen restaurant start ask u show phone would name good enough restaurant another person know name customer imo stolen order come thing customer order want pick claim refund uber deliver restaurant worker mess way hand order wrong driver get deliver wrong person kind driver malicious theft either forgets make something wont admit fault mostly young people work place want get trouble technical difficulty order never make shift change role change restaurant new person clue dont assume another driver take since thats trope social medium id say th likelihood scenario driver take maybe decide quit doesnt care deactivation anymore say f take dinner home last day take wendys trust theyre take steak home last day,0,0,know driver steal food first start gig pretty much every restaurant leave food u pick one leave digital kitchen place average person wouldnt know exist unless driver people driver ive never show steal order yet restaurant driver theft seem happen cheap fast food place pick nice restaurant time would steal worth wendys another clue driver evolution interaction restaurant fast food place start put behind counter eliminate random opportunist take food start ask u name verify good month sudden stolen order start happen restaurant start ask u show phone would name good enough restaurant another person know name customer imo stolen order come thing customer order want pick claim refund uber deliver restaurant worker mess way hand order wrong driver get deliver wrong person kind driver malicious theft either forgets make something wont admit fault mostly young people work place want get trouble technical difficulty order never make shift change role change restaurant new person clue dont assume another driver take since thats trope social medium id say th likelihood scenario driver take maybe decide quit doesnt care deactivation anymore say f take dinner home last day take wendys trust theyre take steak home last day,4,191,"{'neg': 0.516, 'neu': 0.484, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.4939}","{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.724, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.796}",0.0,0.516,0.484,-0.4939,0.156,0.12,0.724,0.796,0

UberEats customer service completely unusable now,"Hey everyone,  
  
I wanted to tell this story because I've been a long-time user of UberEats and I've noticed in just 12 months the customer service has gone from fine to completely unusable.

I ordered two pizzas from them a couple of nights ago, and when it arrived, it was one pizza and it was the wrong pizza. So half the pizzas, and also, not our order anyway.

I tried to use the auto-pop up menu in the UberEats app to flag I hadn't got my order, but instead, they just kept asking if I wanted to cancel my order. They said if I cancelled I would pay **the entire cost of the order I hadn't got as a ""service fee.""**

This happened over and over again in a loop, until I asked to speak to a human agent. Finally, I spoke to someone, they checked the order and then said someone would get back to me within 24 hours.

Just to be clear - I was standing at my door, $60 poorer, without my food and I was being told that someone would get back to me within 24 hours.

Better yet - **no one got back to me!** Ever. Not in the app. Not in my emails. Not in spam. Nowhere. They took my money and ran, without ever giving me my order or contacting me again.

Utterly unusable and reprehensible. Obviously I'm now never using it again, I'll switch to a competitor, but I just wanted to warn everyone.

What do you think happened?,"Can any drivers help me try and figure out what happened? 

This evening I ordered from a place about 1.3 miles from my home. Said it should take max 25 min. My driver is assigned and they start driving to the place and it says the place is still wrapping up the order. They then sit about 2 blocks away for about 10 minutes while the order stays as “wrapping up” when I looked at the app again a little bit later, the driver is now in another part of town not moving and the order is still “wrapping up”

 I wait some more and now after about 40 minutes after I placed the order, I messaged the driver asking if everything was okay. They respond yes, everything’s fine the orders just taking longer and they will be ok their way as soon as it’s ready. No problem I think, though a little weird they left to a different part of town

I keep the map open next to me and then all of a sudden they start driving and the order changes from “wrapping up” to “on the way”, mysteriously without the driver going back to the restaurant. They just start driving from the other area they were in and it’s routing towards me. There is no other location of the restaurant in that part of town. I checked. I’m very sussed out and would love anyone’s opinions and explanations. The photo attached is from right when the driver started heading towards me with the “magically in their car order” the circle is where the restaurant is.

I'm so angry ,"
Update: my bank has reversed the charge after I supplied evidence of both the food and conversations with Uber. The health and safety regulations for food has responded and will start and official investigation. Hope that disgusting restaurant is shut down. 

Ordered food last week from a Thai place which I later found out was a ghost kitchen. A few bites in I noticed the consistency of the chicken was weird. Went to investigate properly and it was fking RAW. Took photos and immediately uploaded it to Uber eats. I was so put off I threw the rest of the food away. One day later I ended up with severe food poisoning.

Spoke to Uber eats in chat, so rude and useless. Told me I'm not entitled to a refund because apparently I have had multiple. The last time I requested a refund was in 2022 for burnt charcoal pizza!! Ended up contacting them through the phone using riders support as we don't have a phone customer service line in the UK. The guy on the phone shouted at me and hung up on me. Tried calling the restaurant, exact same thing. I was shouted at and accused of lying by a guy who barely spoke English. Meanwhile I haven't eaten for 6 days now because I'm still nauseous.

So I did, it wasn’t really that far out and it was actually on my way back home, but I couldn’t finalize the order, so i call customer service and she decided to just cancel the order all together. And gave me 4$, promising repeatedly that the customer would still be able to tip me afterwards.

The scam…,"I placed an order with Uber eats from Wendy’s
2 Spicy chicken Sandwiches 
2 Fries
1 Small Diet Coke
1 Small Coke Zero

The delivery person was suppose to drop the food off at the hotel room. The room number was provided in the delivery instructions along with my phone number in case the deliverer needed assistance in being allowed to different floors, or walking past the hotel lobby. 

Instead of going to the room, or even going to the front desk he sent a message saying “ I am here”, he never said messaged anything after. I said “I’m coming” and was in from of him with two minutes as he was walking into the hotel lobby. He was holding two drinks, and when I asked him for the remainder of the order he said that’s what the restaurant handed him…

I told him he would need to go back because my order had 6 items and not 2, he then called someone on his phone, and that person (on speaker was yelling in another language. He then said show me the receipt, and when I  navigated to the order receipt (he must have seen the confirmation code, which I later realize) I also told him he would need to go the restaurant and get the remaining order as I did not only order 2 drinks. He said he wouldn’t and left with the 2 items (drinks) he arrived with (instead of the 6 originally placed on the order). I attempted to reach out to customer support to cancel the order and the first agent said:

“As I have checked the delivery person contacted you multiple times waited for you for more than 8 minutes and delivered the food to your correct location. however, you are not eligible for a refund.”

I contested and said that “he did not “.  I think he said my confirmation code and made them believe that my order was delivered.

I was livid. No food, starving past midnight, and being told that I was in the wrong (the deliver probably did something to my food ( keep it , give it to someone else, etc.) but then proceeded to make me out to be the villain…

The first agent  kicked me out of the chat, then second said and did the same. The most infuriating part is when they would say this before ending the chat:

“I have provided you the best resolution/information we have for your concern right now. Since we are unable to offer any further resolution, we are closing this chat for now. Stay safe and healthy. Thank you for using our chat support. Have a nice day.” Before ending the chat. 

I wanted to deck them 🥊 

I contacted the hotel lobby and asked if they have video recordings of the entrance and they do. I was able to get video footage of everything I described. I contacted Uber support one more time and mentioned that I have video to support that I never received my order and simply just want a refund. The third agent said the same that the driver followed the guidelines, I asked them to clarify what guidelines they are referring to. No answer provided. The deliverer took a blank black picture as “proof” the order was completed. I let the third agent know that I have video evidence of them returning with the two items he brought instead of the correct complete order. (Keep in mind that the total was $35 including a tip, which this deliverer was keeping). 
The third agent proceeds to tell me:

“We understand this is not the response you were expecting.
However, we won't be able to provide you with a price adjustment on this order.”

I was so drained that I just going to close the chat and deal with it in the morning by disputing the charge with my cc company and submitting the video as proof. 

I told the agent specifically that, “I have video footage from the hotel lobby of this exchange from 10/31/24 at seeing around 12:16 am….”
I also drafted this summary and asked the following questions: 
“I attempted to reach out to two agents prior to simply request a refund and they said that the delivery person followed guidelines…
How?
He never got all the items from the order
He didn’t not follow instructions of “leave it at the door, room XYZ”
He saw over my shoulder, the order confirmation and possibly confirmed the order
He did not return to the restaurant to attempt completing the order (getting the remaining 4 items)
He lied about the interaction
I have video surveillance footage of the interaction from the hotel lobby, provided by the hotel to support the fact I never received any items from this delivery person.

One last thing, I have stellar ratings with Uber eats and would not be pursuing this if I didn’t feel scammed.
I simply want my refund. 

Their proof of delivery is a black picture, I have video footage of them leaving with the two items from the incorrect order…”

Finally they responded with:
“Thank you for waiting, I am happy to inform you that the team has considered this request and normally we don't provide
compensation in these cases, I can understand your situation, and I would like to process a full refund for this order.”

I was finally able to get a refund, which did not include the tip….

To customers: I am so sorry uber and it's partners have pushed me to do this to you. I feel horrible and don't want to do it again,"It was storming tonight.  I figured good pay rates would come through because many people don't want to drive tonight. It seemed I was right. The first order to come in payed more than $2 per mile. This seems fair for hazard pay. I drive miles through the storm to this popular local taco join to pick up the food and am told 'another driver picked up the order'. What this means is that the restaurant workers didn't ensure confirmation of pickup, allowing the first assigned driver to steal the food -_- I contact support but they can't help and the cancelation goes against my account as a demerit. 20 of those and I'm fired/deactivated. Even if it's not my fault. 

I head home and a 2nd order comes through also paying well, and from the same restaurant. I shouldn't have accepted it, but I did. I turn around and drive a few miles back to this restaurant, and this time all the workers laugh in my face saying it has already been picked up. They think it's hilarious. Even the cooks laughing when the window worker shared the news to everybody. I couldn't deal with another cancelation against my account along with everybody making fun of me so I made a bad choice. I asked for a $1 drink and a bag. I put the drink in the bag and ""ghost delivered"" it to the customer. Took a photo of the ""full"" bag in front of the customers door and received the entire $20 rate instead of taking a cancelation and not getting paid plus potentially being deactivated/fired.

I don't want to steal from customers. But because another driver stole the customers food and the restaurant workers won't do anything to stop it I was just fed up. Go ahead and down vote me and say rude things to me, but this is just bullsh*t. Uber will fire/deactivate us because somebody else steals food, and there is nothing we can do about it.

Suspicious Order,"I had a weird experience this weekend.

I get a ping for $35 for 40 minutes. It's a fast food chain nearby and I decide to take it. Not even a minute later, the customer messages me to cancel the order since I'm the 4th driver, and the previous drivers have attempted to pick it up and failed.

I was driving, so I didn't text back, but the customer kept insisting I cancel, which I didn't.

I arrived at the destination, which seemed to be a closed gas station and no restaurant in sight. I checked the order, and it was for one singular drink, worth $3.

At this point, I suspected this was a scheme for something suspicious. I confirmed the order and drove to a nearby store to purchase the item before it got canceled automatically.

Uber informed me that the order could be disposed of, and I was paid in full.

Thoughts?

I'll be adding some screenshots later for further reference.

I think Uber is playing chess while customers and drivers are playing checkers.,"And they’re being a grandmaster strategist. We’re constantly seeing arguments between customers and drivers. Drivers claiming lack of tips and customers feeling they paid enough of fees for them not to tip. As someone who has driven and orders from, both are absolutely true. As a driver you constantly see orders with no tip or little ones with 5+ miles. It’s not worth your time, gas, wear and tear on your vehicle. At the same time, as a customer, Uber tacks you on fees that drive up your $15 order to $25. Naturally as a customer you wouldn’t feel inclined to tip more or anything. So what happens? That order shows up as a $2 for X amount of miles for the driver. What’s happening in the process? Uber is wiping their hands clean. Screw over the driver and customer. Pitting us against each other knowing that drivers will complain with the lack of tips because Ubers base pay was trash. And customers blaming drivers for not getting their orders on time or late because it was grouped with multiple orders. Uber is a corporation and like any other, its employees are just a number waiting to be replaced by another. And all they care about from the customer is their money and how to squeeze the most from them. 

I’ve honestly become tired of arguing for both sides with past posts. We’re literally on the same team and should be focusing on the actual problem of which is Uber. I’ve only scratched the surface on Ubers scummy practices but I just hope in the near future we can start holding Uber accountable.

McDonald's refused service and asked me to cancel the trip,"TLDR: Delivery bag. Long post.

Had a double pickup, same customer order this morning. Picked up the pancakes from IHOP and went to McDonald's for the second pickup which was two iced coffees. Cashier bagged the drinks and was about to hand it to me but some manager or supervisor stepped up and took it from her, saying I need a insulated Doordash bag or I won't be allowed to pick up. 

Restaurant instructions has nothing about bags, and I've never had an issue before with them. Told the supervisor I'm not with Doordash, it's ubereats and I'm just a pickup driver. She says she doesn't care, it's all the same, and I need to have a bag or I need to leave and cancel the order so another driver can pick up. 

I straight up asked if she was having a powertripping episode over this right now? I'm not a minimum wage cook, I'm doing this on my spare time, I'll text the customer and wait all you need. 

Supervisor gave in and handed me the drinks, warning me I can't return unless I have a bag. 

So I complete the drop-off, go offline and call uber. It turns out even though I haven't registered a delivery bag in the driver's app, I can still be matched to restaurants that require a bag, and they are allowed to ask me to cancel. But they also told me to call before canceling and they'll cancel for me and provide compensation. They also removed the negative rating McDonald's left. So that's nice.

Uber Eats Chaotic Customer Service Experience ,"Today, in Greenville County, SC, I ordered via Uber Eats, placing the order at 12:00pm. 

Shortly after placing the order, the Uber Eats tracker showed my driver stopping at the restaurant I’d ordered from, about 12:10-12:15pm. 
The driver then proceeded to drive to a neighborhood opposite my direction, and then to transfer my order to a different driver. 

40-50minutes later, the second driver transfers my order back to the original driver. 

2 hours after my order had been placed, driver no. 1 called to tell me that the restaurant was “clearly closed on Sundays,” so I’d have to cancel. 

I was grateful not to be charged for the food I didn’t get for this order, but had been forced to wait on an order for two hours, although the driver could have told me the restaurant was closed within 15 minutes of my placing the order at 12pm. 

Chatted with customer service. They said that they had done all that could be done, no explanation, no accountability, no compensation for this mishap of negligence. 

But, wait! The story isn’t even over yet! 

I then placed a second order from a different restaurant via UberEats.
The food was soggy, we didn’t receive one of our drinks. We got compensated 5 dollars for this, but the total for those items was $11.29. I’m grateful for the $5 Uber Eats credit. 

Our driver (not either of the two from earlier), came to bring us the order and My brother answered the door. Driver refused to speak at all. The driver also refused a $9 tip in cash, rolling their eyes, turning around and leaving. 

As I pulled into the driveway, the driver was backing out of my driveway but stopping for 2-3 seconds and then moving forward again. I thought she might have just been arriving, and couldn’t find the house because this happens a lot where I live. I pulled up and rolled down my passenger window to ask if she needed help finding the house, but before I could finish asking, she said to me angrily “IM JUST TRYING TO BACK OUT!” I said “Ok, I apologize.” 
Then she stared at me angrily for 2-3 seconds, then began backing her car while saying “I’m just trying to back out! God! Leave Me Alone!” 
I didn’t say anything else to the driver. Just waited quietly for her to pull out. 

I tried explaining this situation all day with Uber Eats Chat to no not much avail, and now have sent an email.

Uber eats is illegally refusing EBT snap eligible items for EBT purchase,"Edit: after arguing with customer service on the app (and being told multiple different things, being told I'm wrong, and they can't do anything to help, also being told I don't understand the system and it must be my fault, even having both my bank and local Calfresh snap office review my receipt to verify and be on chat with Uber eats customer service with me to explain what was going on what they needed and what appropriate next steps are/the laws about this situation,  just to be disrespected and disconnected as well) I finally got a call today. An actual phone call. Uber contacted me apologizing for the discrepancy. They explained I was correct, their customer service agents I spoke with would be trained again on how to handle this issue. 
Basically she explained that when applying a promo, it happened somehow. Tech was notified about it. Apparently it's not uncommon either because I've seen multiple posts online about the same issue for months now. I guess most people don't hear anything back unless they raise a big enough stink about it. 

They apologized to me, corrected the discrepancy, and told me they'd fix the issue so it doesn't happen again. I'm not going to use it again though it's not worth it to me. I hope this can be of help in the future to anyone going through similar. 


EBT is accepted on their platform. Multiple times now they've refused EBT for items with the icon that the store and EBT verified were eligible. 

When I reach out to customer service to figure out why, they basically string me along with a bunch of bullsh!t saying that my items must not have been approved, but then can't tell me what terms weren't. They'll disconnect, they'll tell me ""call your bank"". But my bank, and EBT card, tell me that it needs to be brought up with my receipt to the point of purchase. When I show them this they act like they didn't see my screenshots or read what I said at all. Basically just throwing me to the next agent and then acting like they can't do anything about it. They even try to tell me my receipt from them is incorrect but they can't give me a correct one.

Uber Eats - Riders stealing groceries order,"UPDATE: 24hrs on and  uber has not responded to the ticket raised regarding the order. I will wait until tomorrow and dispute it from Paypal.

———

Ok, let me understand what happened here.

I put an order in for a few items from Sainsbury’s. I see in the app that the delivery is split between two riders. The first one arrives relatively fast and delivers about 30 percent of the order. He tells me that the remainder of the order is coming with another rider, asks me my PIN which i tell him, and leaves. I check the app and see the other rider is about 5 minutes behind. I check the tracking map after about 3-4 minutes and i can see the other rider about 50m away from my apartment building, i keep my eyes on the map as it struck me as interesting that albeit shown being on a scooter (not bike), he is going the wrong way in a one way street. The driver seems static on the map for some time and after a couple of minutes the tracking screen disappears on the app and i get a notification that my order was complete.

I click “help” on the app and get connected to the driver. Although i have i note female in the driver’s picture, a male voice picks up. I ask him where is my order and he says “sorry brother, i went to Sainsbury’s and they told me that the first driver picked up everything”

Understanding there is no point in engaging in a conversation with him i hang up the phone to try to get some help from Uber Eats support. I explained the situation to them over texts, sending pictures of the items that arrived and sending screenshots from the receipt having marked all the items that are missing.

Can someone explain how this scam works? Were the drivers working together? How did the second driver “complete” the order without my PIN? Did the other driver give it to him?

What are my chances of getting a refund for all this?? It feels really shitty being thieved of about 50 pounds worth of stuff.

Waste of money,"So I've had two bad incidents with UberEats in the last month. In early October, I decided to get groceries through the app to save me some time. I placed my order and indicated which items I would not want replaced if they're not in stock at the store. A driver took my order and once at the store indicated to me that smaller pack of spinach and dressing was not available -- I had indicated I would rather a refund than the replacement item. He then continues to bombard me with 5 requests to replace the items with suggestions from Uber, I declined all of them. After 30-35 minutes, when I received my delivery, I see a large pack of organic arugula and a completely random large jar of sauce in the bag. The surcharge was almost $20. Im a broke college student, so thats a lot for me. When I asked the support staff if theres anything they can do, they said ""our regulations don't allow such practices and we take your concern seriously"". BS! I can't even return those items at the store since the they ask for the original payment method... Then there was today, I thought after finishing all my work, I'll treat myself to take-out. I had heard of this local joint and decided to order fish and chips from there. When I received the order, which cost $30 after tax, I received a undercooked, practically raw battered fish and a handful of burnt fries. The tartar sauce that was mentioned in the description, ya.. they didn't give me that either. I asked the support staff if at the very minimum credit was possible, at the very least I could spend my money else where. To which they said ""the behavior you described is unacceptable.. this is very deeply important to Uber.. issuing a refund is not an option on this matter"". Im sorry but this is fuckin ridiculous now.. like there's no way me receiving raw, unediable food is my fault.. or the Uber guy giving me random items without my acceptance is my fault either.

Tipping Question as a Customer?,"Hello!! I am posting as a customer (I use UberEats religiously). I will always tip 28%-30%, but does this seem like an appropriate amount? Like what makes it worth it to you as a driver? Sometimes I’ll order from a restaurant that’s two miles away or sometimes I’ll order from one that’s 15 miles away and I’ll tip the same. 

And can drivers see “history”? For example, I live in a pretty large town but I always get the same two drivers… I was wondering if maybe they accept the order because of my location. I always think it’s awesome because they are both really great delivery drivers (they will text me when they are on their way or if there is traffic slowing them down etc… They worked through a hurricane and delivered food to me several days when I didn’t have power and I tipped extra, of course) I also have a disability which makes it hard for me to go out sometimes when my disease is in flare. I swear, UberEats delivery has saved me from a lot of hassle. 

I am grateful I can pay extra to have my food delivered and I want to make sure that I am staying up to date with what the what is considered a “good” tip.

Done with food delivery services,"I'm so done with delivery services. I'm picking up my food from now on. For three reasons specifically 

1. I'm sick of delivery services allowing drivers to make multiple deliveries at the same time just so they can ""make a decent wage"" instead of of the delivery services just paying drivers a decent wage. This method doesn't work and makes my food take so long that it is cold and soggy by the time it gets to my door.

2. I don't get updated when my order is taking longer than expected and the wait time just keeps updating getting longer and longer every time I open the app....like have some transparency. 

3. Customer service means absolutely nothing to these companies and you have to fight your way through an incompetent robot just to speak to an agent and even then they seem incapable of unwilling  to give you any reasonable reason or solution. 

Tonight I ordered food at 7:30pm and my food didn't arrive until 8:50pm almost an hour and a half later. This is unacceptable considering the restaurant is down the street from me and closed at 8:30pm

Uber needs to do better ,"I live in my car right now so the only way I make any kind of money is with UE. For some reason that’s the only delivery app I can work on, I can’t go any of the other ones. Anyways, for the first time tonight I took the flat rate thinking it would be worth it as it was $17 per active hour and it was for 3 hours, which means I should’ve gotten  $50. I sign up, do the 3 hours and lo and behold I never got my $50. Not to mention they give you the shitty orders that people only tip $1-2 on. I got $6 for each trip so I’m not sure if that was part of the fare, but even if it is that, my trips were 25-30 minutes each which makes I only would’ve gotten $12 instead of the full $17. Uber scams their drivers and I’m sick of it. Oh and the backup? How they take ALL of your earning until it’s fully paid back? They can’t take half of it, they have to take the full amount so if you don’t have extra money lying aside, your SOL. Not to mention they don’t explain ANY of this and you have to find out the hard way. WTF Uber?? DO BETTER AND STOP SCAMMING YOUR DRIVERS. If it wasn’t for us, YOU WOULDNT EXIST.

UberEats charged me twice for an order / removed discounted amount on second charge,"Just as the title states, I placed a grocery order last week, on Wednesday 10/30/24 to be delivered on Fri 11/1/24 8:00am - 9:00am delivery window. UE was offering a promo of  40% off at a particular grocery, so my partner and I chose food from this chain and placed the order. 

For reasons unknown to me, the order was late - driver headed to store at around 8:30am (when I checked the app/screenshots show), he pays for order at 9:50am (per store receipt) and delivers at approx. 10:15am. The total (including gratuity) was $59.37 which was charged to our credit card. 

Today, we looked at our online banking and see two charges from UberEats:
1. The original charge of $59.37 (pending) and 
2. An additional charge of $86.97 (what the order would have been on UberEats without the discount).

We’ve messaged with 3 different CSRs, and not one can give a legit reason for the additional charge/change in price. Each continues to ask for a screenshot of the coupon that was originally applied and that they can’t help us without it. 

By chance, can anyone here provide some insight into this? Goes without saying, but Uber & UberEats have lost my business over this.

UberEats should stop giving out Double Orders,"I started doordashing and delivering for UberEats about a month ago and figured I would do a little experiment and order UberEats tonight to see what it was like from the customers perspective! It's been years since I've used a delivery app.

Well I placed my order by 6:30PM, left a good tip, immediately was assigned to a driver, however, the driver was doing a double order. I did not get my food until 8:10PM tonight!! 

These delivery food apps are extremely expensive for the customer! And it's honestly so wrong that uber doubles up orders and often delivers to the person who ordered the food first, last. Making all the money spent essentially not worth it.

I had this issue last night delivering when I did my first double uber eats order, the lady who I picked up for first was getting ice and I wasn't going to reach her house for another hour so I called customer service to see if I could go to her address first but they said no! Luckily her ice was fine, but I'm not going to be accepting double orders anymore unless it's super low miles and I unfortunately probably won't be ordering off Uber Eats again, because you never know if the driver you get is going to be getting a double order or not.

Someone is using my address for drop offs ,"I’m not sure if anyone could be of any help but the title is pretty much it.

The first time it happened, I thought it was a mistake, but it’s almost every day now there’s a delivery for my address for no one living in this apartment, I asked the drivers to ask them to change the apartment number as it interrupts my sleep (I work mostly night shifts) and nothing changed since. I’m already leaving it ringing, and they keep doing so (and I can’t really blame the delivery persons) and it is unbelievably loud.
It happens again this week and I mistakenly opened the door expecting something else and spoke to the delivery person, and he called the person that made the order, explains what happened and asking him to change the apartment number.
That person was not cooperative, calling me extremely stupid for opening the door for someone else’s order.

Customer has the worst neighbors ever (STORY/RANT),"A lot of apartments in my area are laid out terribly and it also doesn't help that I'm a bit slow lmao. For example: this one really nice lady ordered indian food, her apartment was in an open roof building with different sections to enter from, each section had it's own address (at which I did not realize at first) each section has the same apartment numbers (it was like 101-404) It was a meet at door, so I kept knocking at what I thought was her door, but then she came around the corner and saw me and confirmed the order was for her. I felt like such a moron but then she told me that it happens a lot. Not just with Uber, but Amazon, Grocery orders, etc. And apparently her POS neighbors always steal her orders and packages everytime it happens. Honestly after like 30 seconds of no answer I shoulda figured I was at the wrong place and also the lady was indian and had a very indian name and the door i was at had a calavera decoration for dia de los muertos. I'm not trying to sound racially ignorant but I've grown up around both hispanics and indians and indians usually don't celebrate Dia De Los Muertos from my personal experience, and the addresses WERE labelled on each different section, so it was partly my fault that I almost got her order stolen but I feel like less of an idiot knowing I'm not the only driver who's done that, also I feel like her neighbors are truly terrible ppl, cause talking to her she seemed like a really nice women, she was very understanding and wasn't mad at me at all, also it was a very nice complex, you'd have to make quite a bit of money to live there, meaning theres most likely no real need for them to steal food.

Things that grind my gears as a driver,"1. People who text me redundant information when I am about to deliver.

Examples ""Hey, it's apartment #xxx"" or ""Hey, my apartment complex name is xxx"". 

This information should already be in the description for the order. Please don't text me, I don't particularly want to hear from you. The app will also read it to me interrupting my music which is super annoying.

I'm fine with special requests or other information that is not on the description for delivery. Drivers can't see notes prior to confirming pick up so that would be fine.

2. Poor tippers that say ""thank you so much"". I do this for money not for your thanks. If you're really thankful leave a better tip next time.

3. Poor tippers that Iive in high rises. Especially those that won't answer when you have a problem getting to their apt. Or those that have a pin and won't answer when you get to their door. Why set a pin if you aren't going to be available to receive your order?

4. Poor tippers that are tracking my location during a stacked order because they are poor tippers. I've gotten things like ""Are you driving?"" and ""I don't see you moving to my location.""

Tip better so that your order is less likely to be stacked and you receive your food faster.

  Can someone please explain to me what just happened here?,"  I just received an offer to be paid $31.07 for a food delivery from Sonic.  I went to Sonic but they said the order was already picked up by someone else, which I don’t get how that should be possible considering Uber doesn’t let another Uber driver choose the same pick up you chose.  It should say “This trip is no longer available” or something like that, if another Uber driver deliverer accepts the trip before you can accept it, so if I accepted it no other Uber driver should have been able to do so.  So I am confused there.  I even asked the customer “Did someone else already pick up your order?  The restaurant just told me someone else did already.”  The customer then said “No, not to my knowledge.”  So I showed the messages to the employee there, but he said, “I don’t know what to tell ya.  There’s nothing I can do about correcting the issue on our end.  The customer might just have to cancel the order and redo it or something.”  I told the customer that that’s what the restaurant then told me to tell them to do, and then the customer said “Thank you!” cancelled the order, then I waited for them to redo it.  But I guess the customer decided not to try again because I have not received any new Uber trip notifications since.  This was like 25 minutes ago, and that customer probably got upset and decided to not try again.  

  I am highly disappointed and confused all at the same time.  Every time you accept a trip, it shouldn’t let another driver accept it.  Every time a trip has been accepted by another driver, it always tells me “This trip is no longer available” which I see all the time I’m doing Uber!  How could have someone else gotten the same trip?  Even the customer didn’t receive any notifications of another driver picking up their order for delivery!  I have no idea what just happened!

No tip + negative review justified?,"I had ordered food, driver went to the wrong address (the next neighbourhood over) and left it at the same house number as mine. ""Its late, and maps must have screwed him over"" I thought to myself, so I called him, 5, times. All of my calls went straight to voicemail, no way to contact him. Ended up walking to a strangers' house at 1 am, and getting my food, left no tip and gave a negative review on the driver. Was this justified? I would have happily given a tip if he had picked up the phone and figured it out with me but having your phone off is unacceptable.

Edit addition: Uber also refunded my order after I clicked on the 'didn't receive my order' button for the 10th time, so I'm pretty happy with that as I have heard a lot of horror stories about Uber's refund policy.

Edit 2: Ordered again, same issue, verbatim. Same door as before, inability to call driver.

Fake Delivery Alert - My Uber Eats Nightmare!!,"Just wanted to share a pretty frustrating experience I recently had with Uber Eats that left me both disappointed and baffled. It’s crazy how some people think they can get away with dishonesty!

So, I placed an order and was eagerly waiting for my delivery. The driver was supposed to drop it off at my building, but instead, he went to the next building over. He took a photo of my order being ""delivered"" there and then took the food with him!

When I checked the delivery photo, I noticed it was taken in front of the wrong building – not even mine! What’s even more bizarre was that there was no buzzer code ring—he didn’t even try to reach me.  
Thinking it was a simple mix-up, I tried to call the driver, hoping he’d realize the mistake and swing back. At first, he denied anything was wrong, insisting he had delivered it to the right place. After a bit of back and forth, he suddenly blocked my number, leaving me with no food, no way to reach him, and a lot of frustration.  
  
Luckily, the building he tried to attempt fake delivery, shares the same management as mine. The office staff were incredibly helpful and managed to track down what had really happened.

What frustrates me is that incidents like this can unfairly lead to the entire Indian community being blamed for the actions of a few individuals. It’s disappointing to see hardworking people judged because of the misdeeds of others. It’s a shame that a few individuals tarnish the reputation of a whole group.

Customer said meet at door and went exactly to the address. No one shows up but ring bell says “no one here but please leave message” through the ring bell. I said you mentioned to meet at the door but you’re busy so I will leave it at the front of the door. Afterwards, I took a timestamp picture and screenshot the order. I noticed that the customer icon was moving back-and-forth a building next to it so I thought maybe the customer pinpointed the wrong address. I decided to give the customer a call, but there was no answer. Then I thought about a few instances where something like this happened before and sometimes the customer actually is another building but they eventually go back to the right address and there was no issue. Also, I had instances where I drove off the designated area to find a customer and the customer receives it safely but these kind of notices so I decided to stay put in the pinpointed area.

I posted about this before, people responded 'it's the last 4 digits of your phone number'. No, it's not. Last time the order number was 'TS\*\*\*\*' and maybe that was the code? I don't know.

UberEats has Shadow banned me from Refunds / Reporting Issues with Orders.,"TL/DR at the end.

I work crazy hours and I use UberEats all the time and I have been for at least 8 or so yrs, I know.. unhealthy, expensive etc. I am aware and I generally order healthier options and I do have a decent job which allows me to spend the extra on ordering in. I also use Uber to get to and from work 4 days a week, every week.

Anyway, my issue.

As I said I use UberEats a lot. So I'm bound to have orders that are messed up. Missing items, wrong items, incorrect toppings, etc (main issue is completely missing items).

Example: I'll order a combo and I'll be missing the side or the drink or an extra sandwich or burger.

I'm a person that believes I should receive what I pay for. So, when I'm completely missing an item I'm going to justifiably report this as missing. I will specifically pick JUST the missing item and put through that it's missing. I'll gladly take Uber Cash or a refund, doesn't matter. But if I'm missing what I paid for I expect it to be refunded.

Well, I noticed that a lot of times instead of just refunding the say $5 item out of a $20+ order, they will refund the ENTIRE ORDER. I have specifically stated in my missing item requests even ""EVERYTHING ELSE WAS FINE PLEASE DO NOT REFUND OTHER ITEMS"" and they will refund my entire order still.

Now, I have worked in a similar field in the past and I know things like this could flag my account as taking advantage of refunds or something like that. So, I have even called the customer support line and spoke to 3rd level supervisors at least 4-5 times to tell them this keeps happening and I DO NOT WANT the entire order refunded, I only expect the missing item to be refunded.

Shadow Ban?

So now no matter what my issue is if I report a missing item, wrong item (completely wrong order even) etc I instantly get declined anything, it tells me I'm not eligible for a refund for my missing item and just closes the door on it. Then I have to reach out to chat support and all they do is send that same copy and pasted message over and over and over to me and do nothing. Even if I have photos to support the issue.

So now, no matter what I could get a completely wrong order or be missing an item I have no recourse to have it corrected.

What am I supposed to do? I just had an order that was $45 and it was completely wrong, I sent an image etc and they just completely deny my refund and no one here will eat the food we did receive.

**TL/DR:**

**The restaurants in my area constantly mess up orders and I get missing items about 10% to 20% of the time, over the years this has built up enough reports / refund requests due to this that I believe I'm shadow banned from even requesting refunds. I spend at least $1000 a month w/ Uber between travel to work and food. My refunds are now instantly denied and tells me I'm not eligible even when the order is completely wrong w/ photos etc. Chat support copy and pastes a denial response and does nothing.**",,,UberEATS,26,0,0.4,Its_Syxx,n,1,1,,,ubereats shadow ban refund report issue order,tldr end work crazy hour use ubereats time least yrs know unhealthy expensive etc aware generally order healthier option decent job allow spend extra order also use uber get work day week every week anyway issue say use ubereats lot im bound order mess miss item wrong item incorrect topping etc main issue completely miss item example ill order combo ill miss side drink extra sandwich burger im person believe receive pay im completely miss item im go justifiably report miss specifically pick miss item put miss ill gladly take uber cash refund doesnt matter im miss pay expect refund well notice lot time instead refund say item order refund entire order specifically state miss item request even everything else fine please refund item refund entire order still work similar field past know thing like could flag account take advantage refund something like even call customer support line speak rd level supervisor least time tell keep happen want entire order refund expect miss item refund shadow ban matter issue report missing item wrong item completely wrong order even etc instantly get decline anything tell im eligible refund miss item close door reach chat support send copy pasted message nothing even photo support issue matter could get completely wrong order miss item recourse correct suppose order completely wrong send image etc completely deny refund one eat food receive tldr restaurant area constantly mess order get miss item time year build enough report refund request due believe im shadow ban even request refund spend least month w uber travel work food refund instantly deny tell im eligible even order completely wrong w photo etc chat support copy paste denial response nothing,0,0,ubereats shadow ban refund report issue order tldr end work crazy hour use ubereats time least yrs know unhealthy expensive etc aware generally order healthier option decent job allow spend extra order also use uber get work day week every week anyway issue say use ubereats lot im bound order mess miss item wrong item incorrect topping etc main issue completely miss item example ill order combo ill miss side drink extra sandwich burger im person believe receive pay im completely miss item im go justifiably report miss specifically pick miss item put miss ill gladly take uber cash refund doesnt matter im miss pay expect refund well notice lot time instead refund say item order refund entire order specifically state miss item request even everything else fine please refund item refund entire order still work similar field past know thing like could flag account take advantage refund something like even call customer support line speak rd level supervisor least time tell keep happen want entire order refund expect miss item refund shadow ban matter issue report missing item wrong item completely wrong order even etc instantly get decline anything tell im eligible refund miss item close door reach chat support send copy pasted message nothing even photo support issue matter could get completely wrong order miss item recourse correct suppose order completely wrong send image etc completely deny refund one eat food receive tldr restaurant area constantly mess order get miss item time year build enough report refund request due believe im shadow ban even request refund spend least month w uber travel work food refund instantly deny tell im eligible even order completely wrong w photo etc chat support copy paste denial response nothing,7,279,"{'neg': 0.375, 'neu': 0.625, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5574}","{'neg': 0.235, 'neu': 0.668, 'pos': 0.097, 'compound': -0.9888}",0.0,0.375,0.625,-0.5574,0.097,0.235,0.668,-0.9888,0
UberEats Driver Stole My Lunch!,"Today, I placed an online order with a local sandwich shop that uses UberEats drivers to deliver meals. After 90 minutes of not receiving my meal, I called the shop and was told that the UberEats driver picked it up already.

After 30 more minutes, the tracker status on the app changed from ""order received"" to ""meal delivered"". I waited 5 more minutes in case the driver was onsite and simply updated his app.

When the UberEats did not appear at my office, I called the sandwich shop back and let them know that I did not receive a phone call, text, nor my meal. The manager was sympathetic and said they'd quickly prepare another meal and one of their store employees would deliver it. Within 15 minutes, the store employee placed the order in my hands.

Walmart Ghost Deliveries ,"Just when I was ready to log off and call it quits for the day. I had a Walmart offer for $58.19. It was for 5 different customers going only 21 miles total. I tapped it as quickly as I saw it and made the turn to head toward Walmart, 4 miles from my location. 

At a red light, I previewed the order information. It looked like it was something very reasonable to do for that amount of money. 

1 mile from Walmart, the app chimed the canceled order notification. A sense of disappointment flowed through me but I figured I still had at least 4 orders and would likely still make at least 40 bucks.

Three blocks from Walmart, the app chimed the canceled order notification yet again. Followed less than a block down by a third canceled order. Now. I was starting to get concerned. 

As I was pulling into the parking lot of Walmart to pick up their last two remaining orders, they canceled order chime happened again. I was at this point quite disturbed or at least mildly upset.

I realized that that $58.19 was long gone. 

I proceeded to check in and wait for the Walmart employee to come out with the order. 

And then a thought occurred to me. 99% of all Walmart delivery offers are at most $2 to $3 including tip, driving to three or four locations over a distance of 10 to 20 mi. 

Maybe it was paranoia that made me think that perhaps Uber had decided to start tricking us by offering multiple deliveries for a huge tip amount and then deleting them one by one as described above. Could it even be a thing? Would they stoop so low just to deliver a non-paying zero tip delivery? 

I wouldn't bet on it, nor would I bet against it.

And then the Walmart employee showed up without any cart or merchandise or groceries. I rolled down my window and the woman told me that the orders that I was supposed to pick up had already been picked up by someone else. A full hour before I arrived. 

I mentioned to her that I initially had five deliveries. She nodded and said that all five deliveries were picked up by that same driver an hour ago. She told me that all five customers had called her asking where the hell their stuff was. That they couldn't get in touch with Uber or the driver who picked it up. 

This is why it is so infuriating and frustrating as hell for drivers who have honesty and integrity who arrive to pick up something that someone else took and stole. 

My mind went places that were unjustified yet were a completely logical conclusion based on what I have read in various postings in this forum. 

I can't imagine why anyone would want to steal five sets of groceries from Walmart. 

I would hope that Uber is going to take some serious steps against this thief, if not just in the defense of the customers or Walmarts, but in the defense of the drivers who work with integrity and honesty.",,,UberEATS,7,8,0.83,Xo-Mo,n,1,1,,,walmart ghost delivery,ready log call quit day walmart offer different customer go mile total tap quickly saw make turn head toward walmart mile location red light preview order information look like something reasonable amount money mile walmart app chime cancel order notification sense disappointment flow figure still least order would likely still make least buck three block walmart app chime cancel order notification yet follow less block third canceled order start get concerned pull parking lot walmart pick last two remain order cancel order chime happen point quite disturb least mildly upset realize long go proceed check wait walmart employee come order thought occur walmart delivery offer include tip driving three four location distance mi maybe paranoia make think perhaps uber decide start trick u offer multiple delivery huge tip amount delete one one describe could even thing would stoop low deliver nonpaying zero tip delivery wouldnt bet would bet walmart employee show without cart merchandise grocery roll window woman tell order suppose pick already pick someone else full hour arrive mention initially five delivery nod say five delivery pick driver hour ago tell five customer call ask hell stuff couldnt get touch uber driver pick infuriating frustrating hell driver honesty integrity arrive pick something someone else take stole mind go place unjustified yet completely logical conclusion base read various posting forum cant imagine anyone would want steal five set grocery walmart would hope uber go take serious step thief defense customer walmarts defense driver work integrity honesty,0,0,walmart ghost delivery ready log call quit day walmart offer different customer go mile total tap quickly saw make turn head toward walmart mile location red light preview order information look like something reasonable amount money mile walmart app chime cancel order notification sense disappointment flow figure still least order would likely still make least buck three block walmart app chime cancel order notification yet follow less block third canceled order start get concerned pull parking lot walmart pick last two remain order cancel order chime happen point quite disturb least mildly upset realize long go proceed check wait walmart employee come order thought occur walmart delivery offer include tip driving three four location distance mi maybe paranoia make think perhaps uber decide start trick u offer multiple delivery huge tip amount delete one one describe could even thing would stoop low deliver nonpaying zero tip delivery wouldnt bet would bet walmart employee show without cart merchandise grocery roll window woman tell order suppose pick already pick someone else full hour arrive mention initially five delivery nod say five delivery pick driver hour ago tell five customer call ask hell stuff couldnt get touch uber driver pick infuriating frustrating hell driver honesty integrity arrive pick something someone else take stole mind go place unjustified yet completely logical conclusion base read various posting forum cant imagine anyone would want steal five set grocery walmart would hope uber go take serious step thief defense customer walmarts defense driver work integrity honesty,3,246,"{'neg': 0.535, 'neu': 0.465, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.3182}","{'neg': 0.172, 'neu': 0.739, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.9753}",0.0,0.535,0.465,-0.3182,0.089,0.172,0.739,-0.9753,0

I got a shitty driver am I wrong for removing tip?,"
Hey, Reddit folks! So I ordered 4 items from PetSmart on Uber Eats: cat dewormer, cat ear drops, dog treats, and canned food. The store’s only 4 miles away, and I tipped $26. Right after the shopper started, items were marked out of stock, leaving only the canned food available—which felt odd. Then he started making strange replacements: he tried to replace cat ear drops with dog hot spot spray and the dewormer with a cat stress spray! I told him right away I didn’t want that, but he must have been at checkout already because I couldn’t decline it.

At this point, I was suspicious and irritated so I called the store. I asked about the stock in regards to my uber eats order. The employee asked if I ordered dewormer and cat ear drops. When I said yes, she said they were in stock at the front and that the shopper actually knew this, as he had asked about them before but still ignored it. Apparently, he pulls this all the time and just grabs whatever. She said there wasn’t much they could do but would talk to her manager.

Uber Eats support was no help, either. They said I could cancel but would be charged the full amount. When the guy arrived, I asked him why he didn’t grab the right items, mentioning that the store had previous complaints about him. He claimed it was his first time there but it was so clear he was lying and he was extremely defensive and combative, but the employee described him perfectly.

What would you have done? Should I have left the tip? I usually get great service because I tip well, and I’m wondering how he even got my order in the first place!

"Genuinely, F—k Whatever location update they did","I get a shop and deliver about a quarter mile from where I was parked. I arrive, and start shopping. It’s about ten items and I already know the layout of that store so I think it’ll be quick. I find about half of the items and have to ask several workers if they can check the back for the others. The things they are out of, I communicate with the customer and offer substitutes instead. After not hearing back from her via text, I call her. No answer. So I make the substitutes myself and send another text explaining what I got and why. This whole ordeal takes about 45 minutes. About 30 minutes longer than it should have but it’s still a pretty good order so I’m not too upset. I get in line, and use the QR code to pay. THE QR FAILS AND SAYS I’M AT THE WRONG STORE AND THE ORDER WAS FOR A STORE 45 MILES AWAY. The checker, may God bless her, says it happens sometimes and to just call support. I call support and sit on the line for 15 minutes only to be placed on hold for another 5. At this time I’m over the order, in my car driving away but can’t take any other orders because it is still on my screen. So finally I get back connected with an agent and this woman has the straight up gall to say “Well sir why did you leave the store?” Bi-?! I didn’t say it but I thought it.

Wendy's ,"Imagine this...

You've been driving all night. You stop at a hotel and check in. You're hungry but it's 5:00 in the morning. You hop in the shower, dry off, and sit down on the bed in your hotel room. You open up the Uber app and order Wendy's. You look out your hotel room window and there's a Wendy's 20 yd away but you're too tired to walk over and they don't unlock their dine-in doors for 2 hours. 

You place an order for Wendy's on your Uber app and then you kick back and relax. Waiting for the driver to show up. 

You check your order status after 5 minutes and see that, for some reason, the driver is 20 minutes away with your food. 

You receive a text from the driver when their car shows on the map that they are at your hotel. But it's been a half hour since your shower. You're exhausted. 

Now imagine you're the driver for Uber. You receive an offer to take a delivery for 9 mi for $12. Not too bad. So yeah, grab the Wendy's, hop on the expressway, avoid the toll roads that would add $10 to your delivery cost, and arrive at the hotel. 

And then you text the customer, get no reply, you wait 4 minutes and try again with no reply. You phone the customer and it goes straight to voicemail. And it's a secure hotel with the closed reception desk and no unlocked door. 

The 8-minute timer runs down on the delivery pin required order, and it says to leave it in a safe place and take a photo. 

This just happened to me as a driver. 
I can understand the customer's point of view. 
When I drove those 9 mi and arrived just over 20 minutes after the customer placed the order, my eyes went wide and my jaw dropped when I pulled into the parking lot of the hotel and saw Wendy's within easy walking distance.

What could explain this pattern of requests?,"EDIT: Thursday night I seemed to crack the code.

When I got back home, the offers went back to low$/ghetto.  The strange thing is, my house is not far from a main street with restaurants, definitely less than a mile.  But for some reason it appears I need to drive right to an actual business area to get decent offers.   


I am brand new, started today and haven't taken a single request because ALL of them have been ridiculously low.  But I am realizing it's not just that -they have all been to the poorest parts of town and neighboring towns, which is undoubtedly part of why the tips are so low or zero.

Do these requests REALLY include the tip? ,"I am new, haven't taken any orders yet but planned to start today.  I have worked in lots of pizza restaurants with in-house delivery employment, but this is my first time trying any online 'gig' delivery.  I find it interesting that in all the pages of onboarding information that UE provides, there is NO explanation of the base pay.  It just says the offer you see on the screen includes the tip.  Call me a stickler but I want to know how much of it is actually from Uber!   


**So there is my first question: WHERE (if anywhere) can I see what UE's basic trip pay is (do they call it ""mileage"")?**    
  
So far the 6 or 7 orders that have popped up for me were all so outrageously low, I rejected them all.  But I mean they are SO low, I don't understand how they could possibly include mileage and a tip.  Here I'll show some examples, yall tell me what you think.   
  
**Just me or are these ridiculously low, and is it possible they are just the mileage (not actually including the tip)?** 

Note the last one, insanely far away, the $ amount is less than 50 cents a mile (again supposedly INCLUDING the tip) and does that (2) mean the customer had orders from 2 different restaurants?

Walgreens pickup - F'ing disaster,"I tried to pick up a package from Walgreens today...First time I was directed to that store. I followed the instructions in the app and pulled in through the Pharmacy drive through. There were two cars before me, so I wait maybe 3-5 minutes. Pull up to the drive through and see the pharmacy workers doing pharmacy work, and not giving me a single glance. I wait another couple of minutes. I see cars backing up behind me. I wonder if I'm supposed to notify the employees, seeing as they're still not looking at me. I push the button to notify them, and they tell me they'll be with me in a moment. I wait for another 7 minutes, while the pharmacy folk continuing to ignore me. 

I'm queued up to pick up another delivery, so I'm getting very annoyed. I give up my place in the queue and I go inside. The front checkout (nearly empty) confirms the pharmacy is where Uber deliveries should be picked up, so I walk back. At least 4 more people are waiting inline for the pharmacy inside the store. 

Looking back now, I probably should have seen if they would at least hand me the Uber package, but at the time I felt so frustrated. I canceled the pickup, hoping that I could still get my next order. Which I couldn't. The Walgreens pickup took so long that someone else grabbed my next order, so I arrived to find nothing.

I don't blame the pharmacy workers, tbh. They were clearly overwhelmed. But I am wondering who the hell at Walgreens decided that having pickups at the pharmacy was a good idea? 

I'm really pissed off that I missed my order queued up after Walgreens...Is there anyone who knows if I can make a complaint in the UberEats app for how Walgreens directed Uber drivers? I'm not hopeful that I'll get compensation for a missed delivery...but I'd like to encourage Walgreens to make a better pickup direction for future drivers. What do other drivers think?

"Uber Eats Locked My Gift Card Balance, Blocked Promotions, and Refused to Cancel My Order","Today, I tried to place an Uber Eats order using a promotion I received, only to encounter this error:

>""Promotion codes are not available for this account and all trips will be charged at the full price.""

After the promo failed, I tried placing the order again without it, but then received another error:

>""We've detected a problem. There was an error processing your request. Please visit in-app help for assistance.""

I attempted several troubleshooting steps, including trying a different device, adding a new credit card, and removing/re-adding existing payment methods. Nothing worked; the same error kept appearing.

Notably, I have an $25 gift card balance applied by default at checkout. When I disabled this gift card balance, the order finally went through, revealing that Uber was effectively blocking my use of the $25 balance.

After the order was placed, I immediately tried to cancel it. However, when I tapped ""Help"" and then ""Cancel,"" an error appeared. Upon retrying, the ""Cancel"" option had vanished altogether. I contacted Uber's support via chat, but they informed me they couldn't cancel the order either, as it was an ""automated"" process and outside their control.

In short:

* Uber effectively froze my $25 gift card balance, preventing me from using it.

Uber Eats is a scam,"I’m extremely pissed! I don’t even know why I continue to use Uber eats. Sunday I placed an order for overnight pull-ups for my toddler. He is a boy, so I selected the ones for a boy with Mickey Mouse. The delivery driver then marks the item as received. She messages me and says “just to be sure, these are the correct ones right?” For which she clearly knew they weren’t right because 1 why would you be asking me if those are the correct ones when it shows you exactly which ones to get?! 2 they had Disney princesses on it, not Mickey Mouse…. So I messaged back and said “yes but for a boy, do they have any for boys?” She said they don’t. So I responded and said “I’m sorry for the inconvenience but you can just go ahead and have the item refunded”. When you don’t see the item in store, you have the option to either refund the item or you send the customer replacement items that they have to approve. Instead of her doing that, she said she had the item, and cancelled the order while in store. Now $57 is gone out of my account and Uber eats is saying they can’t refund me or give me any credit.

I just got screwed over,"I ordered from Whatburger and went for their BOGO and that 10$ off 30$ discount for a nice lunch. I checked everything and applied the order but when I saw how much I was charged on my Region account, it was quite a bit more than it supposed to be. I saw that it took off my 10$ off $30 promo. 

So I contact support about it after getting my order and after 7 mins of waiting, I was told to screenshot the promo. After going back on the restaurant page, the promo...isn't there. At all. Right before I was told to screenshot the promo, it was there still since I checked out the terms and conditions of it to be sure i did everything right(im aware of certain promo that doesnt allow BOGO/ discounted food to work with them). So I told them about it and the guy said he can't do anything since the promo 'doesnt exist'. I had my Postmates app downloaded(which is just Uber Eats with a different icon) so I went on there instead and found the promo, screenshot it, and put it in the chat to prove that it exist. When I did that, the guy ended the chat. 

Angrily, I went back through support again and got someone different. Said the same thing with the screenshots but was told that they can't help me. I asked why and I was simply told because he can't. No reason. Just because. Guy ended the chat right after.

Injury following wrong delivery location ,"Hello everyone!

I am posting (on behalf of my now hospitalized father) in case anyone else has experienced something similar to this or has any advice (if any). 

My severely disabled dad made an order for himself and my 2 disabled grandparents the other day. Upon delivery, despite signs on the (wrong) door and explicit delivery instructions, the food was delivered to the wrong door of the house (door is stuck shut and is now unused- not that the circumstances matter). This door is not a considerable walk (for able bodied people) and was only about another 30 feet around the house, for reference. It wasn’t up any kind of hill or uncomfortable terrain, there’s a path leading from the one door to the other.

As the food was already delivered and the order was completed, my dad ventured outside to get the food from the other door, as my grandparents are still less able bodied than my father. My dad ended up falling whilst retrieving the delivery and is now hospitalized with a broken ankle and brain bleed. 

I had him report to support the minute it happened, no compensation was provided but he wanted the driver to be aware to prevent this from happening to someone else. However, I am not okay with this. My father is now in the hospital with severe injuries because neither the delivery instructions nor the physical signs were heeded.

If anyone has any insight into whether this is truly a “nothing can be done” situation or if others have had a different outcome. I think a refund for the order is deserved, at the very least. Delivery services are often utilized by the disabled community and my dad getting severely hurt/hospitalized because someone chose to ignore instructions is just completely unacceptable.

UberEats customer support is abysmal,"**\*\*UPDATE\*\*** I received a phone call yesterday from Maribel at Uber Support which I did not expect. She apologized several times and said they were looking into what happened in order to correct it and that they'd get back to me today. She acknowledge it was mishandled. I received an email today that said, ""*Maribel again with Uber Support. I've reviewed your interactions with our support line and do appreciate you bringing this issue to our attention. We are actively working on improving our line of business to allow our agents the ability to flex outside of our strict policies in order to understand core issues*."" She went on to acknowledge that I will be refunded fully and that my account is active/usable.  This is interesting because **A)** I didn't end up calling support, and **B)** The chats were marked as ""resolved"" so I'm not sure how/when they were forwarded to her for follow-up. Either way, I'm pleasantly surprised by the response. I expected nothing. It still should never take this long, but I'm glad it's maybe not a *complete* dead end. **\*\*UPDATE\*\***

Yesterday, my wife and I were exhausted after a long weekend out of state with the in-laws, so when we got home, we ordered two burgers and two fries from Shake Shake via UberEats at 6:09pm. The estimated delivery time was 6:35 with ""latest arrival"" at 7:00. The order kept getting delayed and ultimately arrived at 7:20pm - 40 minutes after she picked up the food (we live 9 minutes from the restaurant). The driver appeared to be running personal errands en route as they stopped for nearly 10 minutes at a store parking lot on the way (I know Uber can track this, but I took timestamped screen shots of the driver stopped in the same spot).

But the worst par was when I opened my burger to put it on the plate, a cockroach fell off of it and onto the carton. Naturally, we threw all of the food out (in the trash cans outside). I submitted a help request to UberEats within minutes of receiving the order (the order arrived at 7:20, the image is time stamped 7:21). Their response was to refund me for the price of one burger. Their reasoning was that ""in order to be fair to all eaters, they have to be consistent"" so they cannot refund the entire order. After several more exchanges, they held firm in that stance.

I knew their customer service was bad. But this is next level bad. I would have expected a partial refund if I was writing only about the fact that the food arrived 20+ minutes after the ""latest arrival"" time. That would be reasonable. But the fact that they are only willing to refund the single item means that they believe their customers should eat food that's been sitting in a bag with at least one cockroach for, presumably, the entire 40+ minutes it too for the food to get bagged at the restaurant, picked up, and then dropped off at our house.

Either that, or they assume anyone requesting food safety help is a liar. Putting foreign objects on food to get free meals is well known and longstanding tactic, so I wouldn't blame them for being skeptical about any ""there was XXXX in my food!"" complaints. They probably get a ton of them. But even then, take it on a case by case basis. We've been Uber customers for more than a decade, and have placed dozens of Uber Eats orders without major issues like this. There are far easier things to place on food than a live cockroach if the aim was to scam UberEats into giving us a free meal.

At this point, I'm less bothered about the $25 or so I'm eating (or not eating, technically) on the order than I am about the straight up dismissal by Uber's ""Support"" team. If I was at the physical restaurant and showed them a cockroach on my burger less than 2 minutes after receiving it, they'd promptly refund me and/or offer to replace the order. It's disgusting, but also pretty straightforward problem/solution. And if a health inspector found a cockroach in the restaurant's food prep area, they'd be fined and shut down until they could demonstrate that the problem had been resolved. But according to UberEats, customers should just eat everything else in the bag they didn't actually witness the bug walking on.

If anyone has advice on escalating complaints with Uber, let me know. I tried Facebook messenger and X DMs with no luck.

Acceptance rate,"I am a new driver, started 2 weeks ago. 

Yesterday, i accepted a delivery in an area i generally avoid due to bad traffic. while in the area, I received the same similar requests minimum 15 times: 
pickup 3 packages at Walmart, 
price offer: 8-9$ total (incl tips), 
Expected tune: between 55 min to 70 min, 
Drop off: 3 unrelated deliveries at different addresses 
for about 12 miles (i suspect acrual would have been a bit more with the 3 stops). 

Granted, each 15 offers might have had slight variances with one of the factor: stops, price, order of stops, or mileage. Overall, it never was a credible offer.

My acceptance rate was pretty stable at 45% since I started. Yesterday, because of this laughable offer, received repeatedly with minimal updates, if any, it went down to 18-20%. 

I did receive a notification that my acceptance rate was lower than others. I am not worry about it because this offer was an ask to volunteer. But I'm little annoy to receive notification that:
A) I could not respond to, 
B) I could not challenge its accuracy,
C) was initiated by ubereats

I looked through the help resources, didn't find nothing to this scenario. I Contacted the support by chat, wrote my question to the bot, rewrote it for the agent who needed to put me on hold for 3min to look into this. I received a follow up 9min later: a cut and paste of the acceptance rate calculation from the help resources. My question was clearly worded around one request being counted as decline every time a dime was added/removed, stop order changing, or adding/removing 0.1 mile, etc. 

I don't mind receiving the same  requests multiple times, preferably if there is a noticeable effort to make it more appealing. But really? to keep receiving the same similar order 15 times, and then receiving a comment on my acceptance rate was a bit setting me up for failure...

Uber Eats Promo Not Applied,"Hey everyone.

So I had a 40% off code for Walmart and I scheduled an order with it. The order was scheduled hours before the promo expires, and a temporary charge was applied based on the promo.

When my order was completed the price no longer reflected the promo and jumped up.

I contacted support multiple times but these (incompetent) guys keep telling me they cant do anything without a screenshot of the promo; even though I sent my bank statements.

Question about deliveries recently ,"Work long hours for my job and sometimes I decide to have food delivered so I can just go back to my hotel to relaxI work on the road 80% of the time). I know hotels can be a pain so I usually go down to meet the driver but whenever I do have them bring it to my room then I make sure l'm not in a packed parking lot and I always tip more to compensate parking/going to the room etc. for a long time l've never had an issue either way but the past few of my orders that I did ask to meet at door the driver has either: A: just let it at the front desk even when asked to meet at door or, B: texted me saying they're here and then not coming up and waiting in the lobby.
I never fight them on it and usually just go downstairs but it gets a little old considering I do tip extra to compensate for the extra effort. Has something changed where you guys receive less of the profits or is uber not showing the meeting preferences or showing the tip?
Just curious as to why the change has started occurring recently.

Was I out of line? ,"I'm a driver and I just got a report about unprofessionalism. Tried to think about all the deliveries I did 24 hours before the report and out of all my deliveries I only spoke to two of my costumers. 

One was short and to the point. Nothing wrong and we were both polite. The other one I was delivering a meet at door to this ladies house. I knocked and eventually someone opened the door... And by someone I mean a baby. Like he was barley two years old I swear. So I waited an awkward second to see if the mom was coming. Nope. So I asked him if his mom was home. He's obviously shell shocked because I'm a stranger and really only repeated the word ""mama"" while nodding and shaking his head. I felt weird talking to a baby trying to get him to go get his mom for me. He eventually ran off leaving the door cracked but he just started playing with another baby I saw crawling in the hallway. I knocked on the open door and still no adult so I closed the door, went to my car, and called the lady. She answered and said she was handling another kid in the back after I explained the situation telling me to just leave the food on the porch. So I did. 

Then I had to do a U-turn at the end of the road because it was a dead end and when I passed the house on my way out I saw the food still on the porch except the baby had the door wide open and is digging through the bag. I just kept driving (there was a fence and a gate so the baby couldn't run out in the road or anything dangerous like that) but I called the lady again because I was still worried. She thanked me and laughed about the situation. 

Anyways. Maybe that was too long of an explanation but whatever. It was still a funny situation I guess. That interaction is the only one I can think of that might have caused a report from the customers point of view? I mean i still have a good rating and this was my first professionalism report so I'm not worried about that. Maybe I'm just tired but I just hope I didn't make anyone uncomfortable.

Overheard McDonald's employee say they get charged if the driver waits too long,"Does anyone know if this is true?

I was waiting for a pickup at McDonald's when I heard a manager tell her employee to bag my order ASAP because Uber charges them per minute I stand there and wait.

Walmart employee said policy requires separate “compartments”?,"So, I usually do Doordash instead of UberEats, buy I've been doing UberEats lately instead, and I got my first Walmart delivery order. It was a batch of 4 deliveries. When I showed up and the employee came out with the orders, he told me he was actually only going to be giving me 3 of them, and I had to cancel one on my end. He said this is because Walmart's policy is that I need to use different ""compartments"" for each order so I don't mix them up. And the compartments for a vehicle are front passenger seat, back seat, and trunk. I asked him if we could count the back sear and the back seat area's floor as separate compartments so I could take the order, and he said no. I called uber support, and they cancelled the order for me, but it still counted against me for cancellation rate.

I was looking at the Opportunities tab today and saw several orders available for Walmart delivery that were 9 deliveries?? How the hell would a car have 9 compartments?

Some of y'all drivers weird,"Don't take the title so seriously. Just wanted to say what I saw yesterday at lunch. 

In taco bell for lunch. Pop into restroom beforehand. 

Guy at the sink. I go do my thing and the entire time I'm doing my thing I hear the water turn on, off, on, off mixed with little splashing noises. 

I get done and go to wash my hands and dudes arms and face are all wet and he's splashing water all over his shoes. Water all over the floor. Like he took a whole ass mini shower

Then proceeds to the automatic hand wave towel dispenser and smack it about (literally slapped the side and the front of it) until his hand happen to pass in front of the sensor. Did this 3 times. Same smackaroos each time. 

I dry my hands. And leave. 

I'm thinking this dudes homeless or something even though he didn't look disheveled.

He comes out and then stands near the front waiting for food. Whole times he's periodically reaching up the back of his shirt and scratching his back and top of his ass, of which I can see his crack, while chatting to two other dudes up front. 

Big UE order comes out and he takes it! Then walks out to what had to be a 70, 000 dollar truck and puts the order in the passengers side then proceeds to stand there for like 5 minutes just kind of...staring about?

Frickin what? Just remember y'all, when customers seem to get too angry too quickly ...they might have been dealing with drivers like this dude a ton.

Food stolen? Too bad. According to UE Support.,"Currently in customer ""support"" hell because our driver who was delivering our food decided to just take a photo of his hand covering the camera and drove off with our $50 worth of Chinese food. We were told our order isn't eligible for a refund or price adjustment.

My pregnant wife was really craving Chinese food and we both got off work late. Mentally drained, exhausted and hungry, we decided to order from a place called Hunan Restaurant. The driver drove up to our place, parked for a second in our driveway and then drove off. I called this guy 6 times to see wtf was going on. No answer. He just blocked me. When my wife realized we had our food stolen, she began to cry. She was very hungry, emotional, and all she was looking forward to last night was that Chinese food, and we had the unfortunate luck of ending up with an awful driver.

There is a silver lining. I called the Restaurant and explained our terrible situation and thankfully, the restaurant said they would remake our food at no additional charge to us. When I drove over to the restaurant, the waiter there said he called Uber Eats and they explained to him that we would be getting our refund. 

Now I'm going through their customer support, and they  just regurgitate the same information over and over again. ""We can confirm this order isn't eligible for a refund or price adjustment. Thank you for your understanding."" We ""technically"" got the food we paid for. But I really wished it didn't come at the expense of my wife's emotions and having to drive to the place we wanted food delivered from.

TL:DR
I just want that driver to be removed so he doesn't steal food from someone else. But it seriously looks like nothing is going to happen to him.

Uber had me takeover for a Coco robot in Los Angeles.,"Yesterday afternoon in Los Angeles, I got an offer to pick up from a delivery robot on a residential street corner. The offer for $9 for less than half of a mile, so I accepted. 

The restaurant name on the offer was 'Pink Sidewalk Robot'. The robot was exactly where the offer said it would be. It was not an Uber robot, it was a Coco robot. The robot was stuck at a section of sidewalk that was blocked by construction, and it appeared that it was unable to continue a delivery.

The instructions on the offer said to enter the code on the robot that was sent to me via text message. Of course, there was no text message. I called Uber support and they were unable to help. Their immediate solution was for me to cancel the order. I was not about to do that.

I called the phone number on the offer for 'Pink Sidewalk Robot'. Coco Support answered. I gave them the number that was on the robot, then support opened the robot remotely. 

Inside the robot was a bag of food from Pad Thai On Beverly. I grabbed the bag, got in my car, and drove the two blocks to the delivery address. A quick $9 was easily made.

Brain-dread Uber Eats support agents are gonna get my account deactivated ,"At least for shop and pay orders. The payment system with the plus card is garbage. 90% of the time it works, but then it just randomly won’t process the payment and I have to use my own funds and request a reimbursement. I know a lot of times it’s because the amount charged is higher than what the estimate is on the app, but sometimes the estimates are just way off especially for some restaurant order-and-pays. Some restaurants will raise their menu prices and Uber does not update it on their side. 

Anyways, I had a massive shopping order over 250 dollars the other day and I couldn’t fit the entire picture with all the items listed without zooming the phone camera back making the writing hard to see. I submitted it partially showing most the items and the subtotal as the app only lets you submit a single photo. I immediately spoke with a support agent to request a reimbursement as I had to pay with my own money. I then gave him pictures of the receipt in two parts showing all the items and subtotal. He assured me everything would be reimbursed and processed correctly blah blah blah. Over 48 hours later and a few frustrating phone calls and chats with support I finally received my reimbursement. They emailed me saying I would be banned from doing Shop and Pays if I don’t begin submitting correct itemized receipts. I emailed back explaining the situation and how I had actually submitted the receipt pictures correctly to other support agents. No response. Oh well, at least I got my money back. 

Just yesterday I do an order and pay at a restaurant. Again the payment did not go through. The estimate was for around 46 dollars but the subtotal was for around 53. I pay out of my pocket for it. The problem is the restaurant does not provide paper itemized receipts and only texted me a copy of the full receipt. On this order, the uber eats app prompts me for a picture of the receipt but does not allow me to grab pictures from my phone library, so I just submit a picture of a paper with the restaurants name and a few order details. I right away knew this was gonna be a problem. Before delivering the order I speak with a support agent where I was able to send the actual receipt. I also requested the reimbursement. I explained the situation and asked him to make sure to correct my original submission.  He assured me everything will be a O.k. replying with the typical copy and paste prompts of “We are sorry for the inconvenience” “Rest assured” blah blah blah. 

This morning I get an email saying they will only reimburse me the 46 dollars estimate amount as I did not submit an itemized receipt and that I am at risk of being banned from doing shop and pays. If I believe this is an error to please respond to this email with the correct receipt. I received the email through the Uber app, but here’s the thing, the agent that sent me that closed the email discussion so now I can’t even respond to that. 

I’ve now been chatting with support agents to get my full reimbursement and to make sure they don’t demote my account. They unfortunately now have no idea what to do. They go “it seems as though your reimbursement has already been processed” 

What a pain in the ass. Here I am paying out of my own pocket, having my funds held from me for days, risking not getting paid back in full, wasting time with countless support agents, and finally getting threatened to get demoted from shop and pays all because their entire payment system and support agents are ridiculous and incompetent. 

Even though most reimbursement requests do go smoothly, I still have many other examples of when it didn’t. It’s such a hassle! Sorry for the long read.

Scammed by Uber Eats?,"Hello everyone.

I ordered £100 of food from Uber Eats last night that never arrived. Me and my friend tried to contact support and even the delivery driver and we had no luck. But the order says it was delivered and he was able to get our code. I never gave the code to anyone. Not even my friend. So how was he able to say the food was delivered if he never received the code?
Uber Eats claim we gave him the code hence why it was considered delivered. But we didn't.

I received the receipt this morning and the food was supposedly delivered to an address in the Town over so it was no where near our address. 

Has anyone dealt with this? Uber Eats are being incredibly unhelpful and I am honestly quite angry, I've just lost £100. I've disputed it with the bank.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I do not Tip in advance!!!,"This is exactly why I don’t tip in advance. I use food delivery apps a lot, and many delivery drivers are just lazy and rude. Here’s what happened: I ordered pizza but accidentally selected pickup instead of delivery. I called to correct it, and the guy on the phone said I needed to pay a $5 delivery fee. I agreed and told him to charge my card.

When the delivery driver arrived, she called and told me to come downstairs, even though it’s part of their job to deliver to my door. She said, “You should come out, considering it’s out of our area,” which wasn’t true, but fine—I went outside to meet her. To my surprise, she was a large woman who immediately had an attitude. She told me I owed $5 and asked if I had cash. I said no and asked her to charge my card. She went back to her car, got her phone, and called the store.

Then, she started arguing with the guy at the store about what to do while I stood there for 20 minutes. Eventually, the guy on the phone said, “Just give her the food; she already paid and only owes the delivery fee.” She handed me the food, yelled, “I drove over here for nothing, and I didn’t get a tip!”

As I walked back up the stairs, I thought: you’re crazy to expect a tip after refusing to come upstairs, having a terrible attitude, and wasting my time. Plus, she could’ve easily charged my card back at the store.

Minimum Order Price (and related questions),"Hello my friends, I got this promotion (the second one, $20 off a minimum $1 order). So I'm looking to order for the first time if it can be kept free. I'm trying to keep my pre-coupon total under $20 for that purpose. But are there any reasons this won't work? I didn't see anything in the details stating it'd be reduced to $1 minimum, or that the cart needed to be more than $20 in the first place. It allows me to select the coupon but it isn't reflected in the total, which isn't a hard no. Probably doesn't bode well tho.

Uber BLATANTLY removes promo after checkout. This needs more attention.,"I placed a grocery order today on UberEats since I had a 50% coupon. Everything looked good during checkout, I can see the promotion being applied and even after checkout, the correct pending amount is shown in my bank app. 

After the order was completed, the total didn't have the coupon applied so I opened a chat with them hoping to resolve the issue but of course, without screenshot they won't do anything. Instead they just close the chat without even letting you explain the situation. This is the second time it happens to me. The first time I had a screenshot fortunately. I forgot to take one this time, but that's beside the point. I shouldn't even have to screenshot it. They definitely have a way to check if you had a coupon at the time the order was placed.

At this point, I don't even care about resolving the issue. Instead, I want to focus on exposing this behavior. This is so blatant and deserves more attention than it's currently getting. If you guys have any idea how to make this reach /r/all, I'm all up for it. 

I've compiled a list of people experiencing the same thing in the past year. These are only a few, there are many many more.

Cancellation fees on alcohol delivery vs food,"The other day I placed an alcohol delivery order for a few cases of beer and seltzers for ~$400 and then cancelled immediately after placing the order.

I ended up getting charged the full 400ish fee which was surprising since alcohol doesn’t require any preparation and no driver was assigned to the order since it was ~30 seconds between the order and cancellation.

I talked to Uber customer support who said that because “the order was in preparation it cannot be stopped” which I thought applied to food but not alcohol since it’s in a case (i.e., not perishable). I contacted the store who also said they didn’t receive any money for the transaction (which means Uber kept it all) and therefore couldn’t help with a refund or fulfilling the order anyway.

If I knew this would happen, I would’ve at least taken the alcohol but now am ~$400 in the hole. Is there any recourse to get some form of a refund or replacement order? Seems like a hefty fine for a situation where the store or Uber didn’t lose anything. Even a small cancellation fee would’ve been fine but this is a brutal policy especially since I use Uber eats for corporate purposes quite often.

Any help/advice would be appreciated!

What happens to the driver if you leave negative feedback? ,"I have a consistent issue where i make what I think is a pretty simple ask. I have a covered porch and I just ask that they leave it inside. 
Often people will just leave the food on the ground outside the porch door. 

I don't know what the best way to fix this is. 
I have a clear photo of where to sit the food in the app.  Good lighting if it's dark. Clear instructions. 

All I can think of is leaving negative feedback. But 1. I don't want to cost someone their job over something that deeply annoys me but is ultimately frivolous. 
2. I assume leaving negative feedback for one person doesn't get sent along to whoever the next driver is. 

Also is there a reason for why people may be doing this that I'm missing? 
The patio is mesh so you can see inside. It also has numbers on the clear door so they can be certain they are at the correct address. I also leave the light behind the front door on to make it clear they are expected.

Reliable deliveries keep your customers coming back to the Uber Eats app. With this goal in mind, we’re piloting changes to the Uber Eats Pro program in your city*.

Starting November 1, couriers who accept more requests, cancel less, and provide reliable service will receive priority access to higher-paying deliveries** through a new Uber Eats Pro reward called Preferred Deliveries.

"UberEats Won’t Remove a Disputed Charge After I Won—Now They’re Demanding Payment and Refusing to Close My Account
","I won a dispute against UberEats through AMEX after they failed to deliver my order properly. It was dumplings from a very expensive restaurant and by the time the driver delivered them (60 minutes past the time he arrived to deliver them), they were inedible.

The driver was an AH and even though he was in my complex, refused to deliver my order, stopped communicating to me for 7-10 minute intervals, wouldn’t come to the drop off spot, refused to tell me where they were and told me they were “thinking about if they were going to deliver my order or not”!!! 

Despite being on the phone with support as well as thru the app, during 40 minutes of this debacle, UberEats refused to even refund my $1.99 priority fee. I spent a couple of weeks arguing with them (they were truly AHs), I finally just filed a dispute with AMEX, who sided with me, in May 2023 and fully refunded me.

Flash forward, it’s now 17 months later and UberEats still refuses to accept the dispute results and continues to demand payment.

This is their response to me:

""However, it appears a chargeback initiated with American Express has put your account into arrears. Our team’s investigation of this charge leads us to believe it was legitimate and will need to be settled before you can request again. You’ll either need to contact American Express to cancel the chargeback, or let us know which payment method on your account you’d like to charge the arrears to.""

I just want to close my Uber account and revoke any permissions they have, but I am in an endless loop that I cannot seem to get them to move past. Have tried using X, spoke to AMEX again, etc. I know legally they can’t charge me after losing the dispute (confirmed by AMEX), and that they themselves lost the dispute with AMEX, but they don’t seem to care what’s legal. Has anyone else dealt with anything like this? Any suggestions to get this resolved? I told them to send my account to collections if they want to, but to close it out. And still, they refused.

Edit to Add:   
Uber has violated the **Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA).**   
The merchants' terms of service do not and cannot supersede federal law or the binding resolution of the credit card chargeback process. The FCBA protects consumers from continued collection attempts after a charge has been lawfully disputed and resolved.

Their correspondence with me actually violates the FCBA, in every possible way, including continuing to request payment. It turns out that if a merchant disagrees with the dispute, legally, they can appeal it but they have to have new/additional evidence, to prove why they're appealing. All of my evidence was screenshots of our entire chat, which included my initial request to Uber to just refund my $1.99 priority fee, which I felt was a reasonable ask under the circumstances. Uber denied me. Amex made the decision to give me back the entire order amount (less the $15 fee that Amex paid as a part of my rewards). 

I filed a complaint with the **California AG**, the  **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)** and **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB**). I will update when I get responses and let everyone know if I have any success.

Grocery order from Uber Eats is the biggest scam,"I've been an avid Uber Eats user for years, but lately, my experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. It's become a regular occurrence for me to open my app and see an unexpected ""adjustment"" added to my order, sometimes as much as $20!

There's no clear explanation for these charges. One time, it was labeled as a ""delivery fee adjustment,"" but the initial delivery fee was already included in the original order. Another time, it was simply listed as an ""adjustment"" with no further details. It's incredibly frustrating and feels like I'm being taken advantage of.

Has anyone else encountered this issue? If so, let's share our stories and demand some answers from Uber Eats.

Food got stolen today from one of uber driver caught on camera,"I've been using u/uber for years, and this is the first time my food got stolen by a driver. They dropped off the order, took a photo to confirm, but then left with the food. Unbelievable. I reported it to Uber support, and they said they'd investigate and follow up with me. Hopefully, they take action and deactivate the driver/thief responsible for this.

**Update**: I gave her the benefit of the doubt, calling her three times through the Uber app, but she didn’t answer. That’s what truly frustrated me. I wanted to give her a chance to correct the situation, but she chose not to. I usually tip 24% or more, especially when the order is small or the drive is longer. In this case, the trip was only 1.3 miles, my food cost $31, and I tipped her $8.03, which I believe was fair and generous for the distance and time. It's disappointing when you try to be fair and reasonable, yet people fail to act with integrity. I also contacted Uber, and while they refunded my order and gave a credit, I made it clear this wasn’t about the credit. It’s about doing what’s right and upholding good values.

"I’m curious about how drivers see/accept tips. I have an experience from today, with an incredible driver.","I don’t post on Reddit very often, so I hope I’m going about this correctly.

I’m wondering if a tip is increased later, does the driver see where it came from? Actually so many questions about tips. Hopefully drivers are receiving the full amount. And do you see the tip before accepting the order? I’m a good tipper (i work in the service industry) but I added extra to my tip for today because of what happened at when the driver showed up. I always watch the car on the vehicle tracking act. I don’t care
So much when it’s take out, but this was alcohol, so I had to meet the driver with my id. So I’m watching my phone. Apparently the driver was still 3 mins away. And I get a phone call from an unknown number, and my phone tells me it’s “likely spam”, so I don’t answer. Then a minute later the driver is at my door. Now here is where I feel horrible, and want to increase the tip. My friend and her dog were over. We were inside, and I was waiting to meet the driver outside (hence watching the app) but we hadn’t heard him enter the yard, and my screen door wasn’t
Properly latched, so Dorian (the dog) saw someone outside and was able to open the unlatched door. Dorian is not an aggressive dog at all, but he is big and ten months, so crazy energy. 
The driver was amazing and understandable, said there was probably some glitch in the app that didn’t show his arrival.  Anyways I just feel horrible that he had to deal with the dog craziness, so I tipped extra afterwards. I guess I’d just like to know if you add more tip later, does the driver see the order it’s coming from? I’d like him to know it’s my way of saying I’m sorry he had to deal with that. I apologized to him lots in person, but an extra tip helps!

It is the Governments role to fix the pay problem: way too much wasted energy blaming Uber and Customers,"Uber sucks, they are corporate scum. Low tipping customers are even worse! It's like nearly every post. I get it. We should encourage good behavior by corporations and by customers. But thats just wishful thinking. The system is just basic economics in a free market economy: people want cheap food, Uber wants to make as much as it can, and drivers are willing to drive for awful pay on the hopes that they will have a good night.

The only answer is for local, state, and federal law to recognize the problem as a workers rights problem and force fair wages. The system should not rely on tipping. Customers should have fair after-expense minimum wages built in to their costs. Just like in so many countries where food costs are high at restaurants, waiters are well compensated, and tipping doesn't even occur.

I was a little bit dumbfounded by this reply since it did gave no conclusion to the previous order or deliverer and more than a little insulting.

Glitch caused food delivery issue.. will the restaurant get paid? ,"There is a TLDR at the end! 

I ordered from a local pizza place tonight for delivery, about $30 with tax before tip. No promos used but I did use an uber gift card balance. 

The driver called me after about 10 minutes asking me where I was, I stated on my porch thinking they had just gone down the wrong street, pretty common mistake. She said well where's that? The uber app is telling me to deliver the food to the restaurant I picked it up from!"" She then handed the phone to the store worker, who was kind after I told her to have the driver call Uber, I can't do anything about it but I'll call too. So we both hung up and called, ubereats chat support was extremely unhelpful and disconnected after I said four times ""it is not about the delay, the driver is unable to deliver the item entirely.  Yes the item was picked up, can you change the address or not?"" Apparently they cannot as SAPNA (actual handle)  ended the chat. 
I called the eats support number and she confirmed there was some kind of glitch on the driver's app side, as she and I both saw the correct delivery address.  I asked the phone worker to communicate that to the driver and tell them they will be compensated, she said she couldn't reach the driver and to call back if the food quality was bad if it arrived since it was picked up. I asked totally exasperated, if they cared at all about this poor driver going in circles for an hour due to their issue, or about the customer experience, or does uber only care about cold food?  She said yes, call us if your order is bad. Until then I can't help you.  So I hung up.  Driver arrived about 2 minutes after I hung up, 48 minutes after picking up the food. It was obvious the Driver is a senior trying to make ends meet, she couldnt understand how to input the pin so I assisted.  She couldn't stop apologizing and told me the man she spoke to ""forced the order through"" which is how she was able to deliver it.  I could see in her face she expected this one to be a total loss, she seemed defeated. 
So I increased the tip to match the order cost.   It soothes my guilt and hopefully will make her night just a little better.  But I do want some kind of apology from ubereats, my options seem to be to claim the food is cold/ damaged or just deal with it.  UberEats admitted this was their system, so I don't want to dispute the food as cold and have the money taken from the restaurant, nor Driver.  Will they be punished if I report the actually cold food?  

Tldr: ubereats Driver app glitched showed the pick up location restaurant as the drop off. Senior driver not terribly tech savvy spent 45 minutes to get my order to me. UberEats admitted it was their glitch to me over the phone, said they could not give a promo or anything for the issues unless I report damaged or cold food. It is cold but clearly due to UberEats. If I call and report it as such, will the restaurant still get paid or will UberEats blame them if they give me a credit or discount? If that's the case, I'll never use UberEats again.  So I appreciate anyone with insider knowledge.

Just finished my 100th delivery after my first 2 weeks delivering. Some initial thoughts: ,"Some of this might be common knowledge here, but this is my first time to this sub. 

1. The app is buggy at times and has a lot of weird little quirks, some of which make driving and navigating the app outright dangerous. I am on android, and if the Uber eats app is closed out or my phone screen turned off for any reason and a trip request pops up, it does not allow me to see the trip in detail so I have to blindly select if I want to take a trip without knowing anything about the path. Also the user interface is just non intuitive in many ways, and seems to really prioritize not being able to access any information except for exactly when the app thinks you will need it (trying to find someone's address when you haven't picked the food up yet etc. you cant do that?)

2. Something thats happening a few times is someone will order fast food late night and in their order will be some dessert thing which the store is out of. On my end it does not allow me to call the customer until after I've picked up my orders, I can only text them for whatever reason. So now I have this situation where I need to decide if I cancel the whole order, or else I'll text them if they want a substitution, but of course they are never quickly responding to the text and now I'm holding up the drive thru? I don't know what to do in this spot, and I don't know what options the customer has to make things right with Uber on their end if I do just bring the incomplete order.

3. Delivering to apartment complexes sucks

4. People that order yet somehow seem to not be aware that their order is coming, or that they should be somewhat ready to answer the door, absolutely suck. (if they have ""meet at door"" or PIN on)

5. McDonald's method of putting drinks inside the paper food bag is crazy to me. You can't tell what's going on in there, or if everything is okay. Sometimes I can't be sure that a paper bag is perfectly upright throughout a trip. I'm convinced my only thing down so far is because of a spilled drink in a McDonald's order.",,,UberEATS,14,3,0.71,chis5050,n,1,1,,,finish th delivery first week deliver initial thought,might common knowledge first time sub app buggy time lot weird little quirk make driving navigate app outright dangerous android uber eats app close phone screen turn reason trip request pop allow see trip detail blindly select want take trip without know anything path also user interface non intuitive many way seem really prioritize able access information except exactly app think need try find someone address havent pick food yet etc cant something thats happen time someone order fast food late night order dessert thing store end allow call customer ive pick order text whatever reason situation need decide cancel whole order else ill text want substitution course never quickly respond text im hold drive thru dont know spot dont know option customer make thing right uber end bring incomplete order deliver apartment complex suck people order yet somehow seem aware order come somewhat ready answer door absolutely suck meet door pin mcdonalds method put drink inside paper food bag crazy cant tell whats go everything okay sometimes cant sure paper bag perfectly upright throughout trip im convince thing far spilled drink mcdonalds order,0,0,finish th delivery first week deliver initial thought might common knowledge first time sub app buggy time lot weird little quirk make driving navigate app outright dangerous android uber eats app close phone screen turn reason trip request pop allow see trip detail blindly select want take trip without know anything path also user interface non intuitive many way seem really prioritize able access information except exactly app think need try find someone address havent pick food yet etc cant something thats happen time someone order fast food late night order dessert thing store end allow call customer ive pick order text whatever reason situation need decide cancel whole order else ill text want substitution course never quickly respond text im hold drive thru dont know spot dont know option customer make thing right uber end bring incomplete order deliver apartment complex suck people order yet somehow seem aware order come somewhat ready answer door absolutely suck meet door pin mcdonalds method put drink inside paper food bag crazy cant tell whats go everything okay sometimes cant sure paper bag perfectly upright throughout trip im convince thing far spilled drink mcdonalds order,8,184,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}","{'neg': 0.097, 'neu': 0.822, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': -0.6193}",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.082,0.097,0.822,-0.6193,0

Satisfaction Rating Help,"I started driving this month and have completed 144 deliveries.

"Did an experiment, definitely learned!","I have only been driving for UE a few weeks, but I haven't ordered from the app itself in years. Today I wanted to see what the customer experience is like. I ordered one meal (no drink) from a place around 6.5 miles away. Spent about $20 or so. Accidentally tapped the button for a free Uber One trial, if that matters at all. 🤦 I tipped $10 up front (I know this probably sounds like a bad one for the mileage, but it is actually pretty good compared to the tips I see in my area; plus, I thought better of it and added another $3 after delivery).

The order was accepted pretty quickly, I think. My driver did end up completing two orders, so I'm guessing that mine got stacked with a no tip offer. I was not able to see where the driver was until she got to my restaurant, but the app did tell me that she was completing another order. Delivery was good, instructions followed, and she left a nice message after leaving it on my porch.

I did see that while ordering, the default tip options are not dollar amounts like DoorDash has. They're percentages, and weird ones, like 18% and 23%. So, people who generally don't like to tip more than 20% would probably pick the 18% option instead of the 23%, although they might have chosen 20% flat if that option had been available. Strike one for Uber deliberately structuring things to screw drivers. There is a custom amount option, but it does take slightly more effort and is a dollar amount instead of a percentage, so I can kind of see how customers would just take the easy route.

I did have a special request for the restaurant, but there was nowhere to put that in my order screen. I knew the driver likely wouldn't see delivery notes until she had already left the restaurant, and I didn't want to bother her by messaging. I called the restaurant and made the request that way, and it was correct when I got the food.

Anyway, I wish I could talk to my driver, I just have a couple of questions. Did she accept another order while working on mine, or was she already on one when mine came up, and if so why? Did she feel my offer wasn't good? Or was it already stacked with a bad offer? No shade either way, I understand the game, just curious. Also, I'd really like to know if she received the full $13 tip that I sent, and what the base fare was for my order. (Or if she even could tell that if the order was stacked.) If it was stacked, did it seem likely that mine or the other was the better offer? Does she remember the order in which she was instructed to pick up and drop off? Does she remember the original offer amount from UE?

It didn't occur to me until later that I could have placed the order and then gone online and accepted it myself, so I will probably try that at another time.

This is a long shot, but if you're on this forum, I'd love to DM with you. Driver name started with A, and you delivered an order from Metro Diner in OKC with a drop off time of around 1:30 pm central time. If you're comfortable, I'd really appreciate a DM to talk about those questions.

Like I intentionally made it hard for her. 
Like real screaming. 
She also hung up on me in the first and second call. 
Finally got the food and it’s ice cold.

How can I help you?,"I'm looking for advice from dashers, not to bash anyone. I order out a lot and live in a condo ""community. The order of units is not super-intuitive and the lighting is less than ideal. I know this makes delivery difficult, which is why 95% of the time, I try to meet the driver at the street to collect my food. I provide very clear directions to my unit in the notes section, but learned years ago that dashers don't usually have access to the notes. If they do, hardly anyone reads them. So if I want to dash, I plan on going outside to collect the food. I never tip less than $10. If the recommended tip is more than $10, I will add at least a few bucks. I am kind and respectful to drivers and don't waste their time. 

What happened last night wasn't an isolated incident. I was standing at the entrance to the ""community"" where the sign makred with the address is. I was holding my phone up with the flashlight on. I was careful not to shine it directly at the car as it approached but I was still clearly visible as he drove past me into the parking lot. I start walking toward the parking lot and I see the driver pulled over behind some parked cars with headlights flashing. 

As a customer, I can never be 100% sure that the car I""m looking at is my dasher. There are not signs on the cars or descriptions given. It seems unwise to startle someone by walking up and tapping on their window. I stand at a respectful distance, waving my phone to indicate I am looking for someone. The driver just sits there, so I'm thinking maybe he's not the person and I'm freaking him out, so I start back to my condo. Then I see him get out of the car. Now I have spent several minutes walking around in the dark and it is raining a bit. I approach him and tell him my name. He confirms he is the dasher. Then he wants me to wait while he gets his phone out to take my picture. At this point, I was frustrated and told him to go on, but he kept following me, insisting he neeeded the picture. I held up the bag and said ""take it."" He kept going on and on explaining to me and I""m standing here in the rain with a bag of cold food and I say again ""go ahead and take it!"" until finally he does. I regret the tip, which was double what was suggested but oh well, that's the way it goes. What is the point of this when both the driver and the customer end up being unhappy? 

Is there anything I can do to make these deliveries more convenient for the dasher? I am willing to do my part to make these interactions better for all, but I am at loss as far as what else I could do. Thank you for any advice.

Weird experience today,"I’m a customer, just genuinely curious if this driver would have gotten in trouble or anything. 

Ordered breakfast from a place 11 miles away. Tipped $15. 

Got the “your order has been picked up” message a little while later. Looked at the map, saw the driver was moving toward me but still had a ways to go. Went back to scrolling Reddit. 

Suddenly realized it had been a while and looked back at DD. Driver hasn’t moved at all. Checked and it’d been 30 mins since pickup. 

I waited a couple more mins and saw the driver wasn’t moving whatsoever. So I text asking if everything is OK but get no response. I considered calling but the app says the driver speaks Spanish. 

So I reach out to support. By now it’s been 40’minutes. They try to reach out but can’t reach her. 

Then support just ends the chat on me. So I had to start again. 

I tell the new guy it’s now been 50 minutes. He reaches out to her and says he did reach her but he doesn’t speak Spanish either. I assumed DD support would have a Spanish agent call but whatever. 

So I’m getting nothing from support and the app still shows the driver in the same spot like 10 miles away. 

The agent asks me if I want to cancel for a full refund. 

I type “fine cancel and refund me,” hit enter and ding dong. Someone’s at my door. Sure enough it’s DD with my food. 

I tried to talk to her but she spoke no English. 

By the time I get back to my phone I see in the chat the agent tried to confirm with me that I wanted to cancel then closed the chat. 

I divvy up the food between my wife and myself. It’s not as hot as I’d like but it’s otherwise fine. As I eat I check the app again. I get a notice my order was cancelled. I didn’t get a refund but was given a $10 DD credit.

Sudden drop in Satisfaction Ratings,"Uber Stuff



My satisfaction numbers went from 95% to 82% in a matter of two weeks! How can I lose 13  pts in my satisfaction numbers in just a matter of two weeks?? I’m eager for feedback, 



1. I am an Uber Direct/Eats driver.
2. 90% of my deliveries are from Wal-Mart to residences. The rest are from  I do NOT take riders.
3. My satisfaction numbers were 95% for the last 4 months
4. I have made nearly 400 successful deliveries
5. I often receive tips in cash over and above customers’ online tips
6. I’ve gotten to know many of those 400 customers and we always have pleasant exchanges
7. I send a short message to each customer indicating where I have left their packages, and letting them know it was “my pleasure to serve you today.”
8. I take great care with customers’ packages, placing heavier items where it’s easy for the customer to lift, I carefully separate eggs, bread, chips, etc. to avoid breakage.
9. I’ve worked hard to reach the Platinum Level and I need only 26 more points, and now this plunge in my satisfaction numbers will disqualify me!!
10. I’m the same person I as two weeks ago!

Help a former Uber rider,"Hi everyone,
I was assaulted by 3-4 people while delivering food on an electric bike for Uber Eats. I was hit in the face with a metal bar for my electric bike. I had a broken cheekbone and eye socket, I had a surgery for reduction and fixation of left complex zygoma fracture. I have ptsd and depression since the assault. I'm not been able to work since, I filled a CICA claim and PIP but I haven't got a decision yet. I'm behind with rent and bills, probably getting evicted next month. Is there any other help I could get? I really don't know what to do.. I'm just waiting and it makes my mental health even worse.
I created a GoFundMe where I explained the situation in more details.
Also if you could share it that would help a lot.

So here’s a bit of an AITA post. ,"My daughter works at a nearby restaurant. I like their food a lot. So I got about $20 worth of food delivered. My car is not currently working so can’t pick it up. 

After I ordered I thought it would be funny to ask him to say hi to my daughter. So I messaged him and said if you say hi to my daughter .. <first name here> I’ll give you an extra tip. If I get an “OMG mom” text I’ll tip you even more 

He replied HAha. Will do. I also replied if you don’t feel comfortable I’ll still tip you extra either way. 

And I quickly got a “you’re dead to me” text from her.  He replied and said she thought it was funny. My daughter’s text didn’t surprise me. I could tell she wasn’t mad 

So took what defaulted to an $8 tip to $25 because he did it and it made my day and made me happy.

My son thinks it’s wrong I even asked… because he had to “perform” for me. I actually upped the tip before he even did it because I know some might find it obnoxious. But I love he did and it made me happy. What would you think if you got the his message.

UE sucks but it's up to us to make the experience better for everyone!,"So, I accept a delivery yesterday and as I pull up to the restaurant I get a message from the customer that they are trying to cancel the order as the location doesn't have the ingredients and can't fulfill it. However, they don't have a number where to call and the AI doesn't offer the refund although the order can't be made by the restaurant. The customer is desperate. The restaurant can't cancel on their end either since it's third party order: order can get cancelled only by the customer or the driver (but in this case order just goes to the next driver, then the next... you know the drill).

I send them a phone number that I use to contact Support. No luck, the number is only for drivers or restaurants. I look on the Internet, find some number, send it to the customer and bingo! They have a human and all is sorted out for them. Order cancelled, I go home.

Today, I have deliveries and what do you know! The same customer orders from another place. I saw the name, thought about the one from yesterday, but what are the odds, right? It turned out it was them! And I got a nice note and it really warmed my heart!

Let's be good and kind to each other. UberEats sucks and treats us like crap, but we can make everything so much better for each other and treat each other with kindness and respect!

Automated system mistakenly cancelled my order - do i dispute with bank?,"Hi everyone and appreciate any assistance here.
I put in an uber eats order for a potluck for a Panda express tray. The estimated time was 25 minutes at first.

It then suddenly switched to 2 hours… which would be too late. So i looked into canceling the order. It said it would charge me $75. The automated system asked me if I’d like to cancel my order and I said “no don’t cancel” and It still cancelled anyways, and charged me $75. So now I’m down 75 dollars and nothing to bring to this potluck.

I disputed this with three reps and said nothing they could do. I called Panda and they said they never received the order to begin with - so it just seems like a scam for Uber to take my money while putting on a facade that they care about the restaurant’s time.

I am fully planning to dispute this with my credit card but would that ban me from uber rides forever? That might be inconvenient.

Zero Tippers Are Not The Enemy,"I see so many negative posts on here about zero tippers, and you've all got it wrong. Zero tippers aren't the enemy, and zero tipping isn't actually a thing. It's just framed that way by DoorDash to make the dashers blame the wrong people for their low pay.

I'll use a restaurant that's close to my house as an example. I just pulled up their menu off of their website. An entree and two appetizers I've selected comes to $28. I could just drive over there right now and get this meal for $28 + 6% tax which would be $29.68.

They used to offer free delivery within my radius. If that was the case right now let's say I'd give the delivery guy $10 as a tip and my total would be $39.68; I'd probably just give him a couple $20s and tell him to keep the change so let's call it a tip of $10.32 (that's a 36.86% tip). So that being the case, we can assume that the delivery service for this meal is *worth* $10.32 to me.

But they don't offer free delivery anymore, instead they have subcontracted their delivery to DoorDash. I just looked this up and the exact same entree and two appetizers ordered through DoorDash right now is not $28 but $40.80 which is an approximate markup of 40% (wow!). That's an extra $12.80 I'm paying already for the exact same food, but keep in mind I also pay extra tax on that inflated price so instead of $1.68 in tax on my meal I'm now paying $2.45. That's another additional $0.77. So the total additional cost on *just the food* is $13.57. But that's not all! There's also a Delivery Fee (right now for me it is $0 due to a promotion but that's not necessarily always the case), and a Service Fee of $6.12. Let's be real here, the distinction between a Delivery Fee and a Service Fee is nonsense since the only service they provide *is delivery*. Now I'm paying a total markup of $19.69, and it's only *that low* because of a promotion for this restaurant.

As a customer I don't distinguish between any of these fees, including the tip. It's all just additional money out of my pocket that I'm going to have to pay to have the food delivered, and I need to decide if the total additional amount is worth it to me. So whereas before I was willing to pay $10.32 for delivery and 100% of it would go directly to the driver as a tip, now I'm having to pay $19.69 for the same service *before I've added any tip at all*. Compared to my original example that's equivalent to a 70.32% mandatory tip being added to my order.

But while I'm paying nearly twice as much for delivery already, it isn't actually worth even one cent *more* to me just because the delivery is provided by DD instead of by the restaurant. If anything, it's actually worth *less*. Why is it worth less? DD's interface is frequently out of sync with changes on the restaurant's menu which is annoying. I don't have any of the benefits of having a repeat known delivery person from the restaurant. Plus, with DD I'm getting a random person delivering this, and I'm sad to say from experience but there's something like a 30% chance that the delivery will be terrible in some way, and when something goes wrong, I *know* I will also have an awful customer service experience with DD.

So what am I left with here? An inferior delivery experience that I'm being charged nearly twice as much for? I'm squeezed by DD on these fees so much that I'm right at the tipping point where I'm considering not placing the order at all because it's too expensive. Do I want to add an extra tip on there on top of this, knowing that my dasher might still be terrible? No, I really don't. And as I pointed out, I *am* a tipper. I was previously leaving a generous 36.86% tip, but the money I had reserved for a tip is already over budget by 91% just from the fees. As a customer I really have no clue how much of that is already going to the dasher, but I assume since they took the job they are okay with how much they are being paid. If they're not they should take that up with DD. That part of how the fees are disbursed is between the dasher and DD and has *absolutely nothing* to do with me as a customer.

Here's another example. I used to use a lawn care service. They were a big company and could come and mow my lawn quickly with two riding mowers. They'd do the mow in 30 minutes, but they were bad at responding to special requests so I dropped them and hired someone local who was a college kid. I gave him a shot but he asked for twice as much as the big company just to mow the lawn because he only had a small push mower and it took him two hours to do the mowing. But here's the thing he didn't understand. It may be more work for him, but as a consumer it's not *worth* twice the money to me for him to take four times as long to mow my lawn. If anything, it's actually worth *less* to me because of the inconvenience of having the job take longer to complete. If he wants to invest his money in better equipment to be able to mow faster and take more jobs, he can earn more money, but that's on him. I'll pay the same rate for the service of lawn mowing whether it takes 30 minutes or two hours. This is my job as a consumer. If the service becomes too expensive I have to either consider cutting costs somewhere else (tip I'm looking at you) or I have to take my business elsewhere.

And that example also illustrates my point with DD. Dashers are complaining about ""zero tippers"" like the tip is special. But it's not special, it's just another line item that makes up the aggregate delivery fee. People act like those customers aren't paying something for delivery, and that's just not true. They are paying *A LOT* for delivery. They are paying *way more than it is worth* for delivery. It's just that the money is being taken by DD because their pricing model is jacked, and they're not going to change because people keep dashing and accepting their current garbage terms, and believe me they are quite happy with deluded dashers who believe that the customers are the enemy, when the true enemy is obviously, ***obviously***, DoorDash itself.

Locked in the middle of a dash nyc,"If anyone works in nyc, I was on Jamaica ave and got a order for target. 
If you know anything about Jamaica ave, it’s a crowded mess. I had to park almost two blocks away. Once I got to the store i seen what I had to shop for. One customer it was two iPads and AirPods, another was two water bottle packs (the big ones with like 48 bottles). 
I didn’t expect that I would get such a heavy order like that but, it took so long to check out at the store because the manager had to confirm all the electronics (understandably). Then it took even more time to carry the two water packages to my car.
I weight 150 and I’m not frail by any means but I’m not strong enough to carry those two containers.
 I ended up using every fiber in my body and carried it to my car(took a little while).
 As I was making my way to the customers I called DoorDash support to let them know why I was behind schedule(according to the time given to me in the app). They told it they have documented this and I will be fine.

Serious Scam involving dashers!,"So this happened a while ago but I need to let you guys know about it being a Dasher. I got a very small order but the tip was good so I figured what the hell let's go as always. Soon as I reach the pizza restaurant somebody had ordered a 50 cent cup of ranch sauce. I thought it was odd but as soon as I walked out of the restaurant after pick up doordash called me. 

The caller ID picked it up a doordash as usual and the guy on the end instructed me to sign out of my doordash and he let me know that the previous order was canceled and they will be compensated me with $8 not bad at all. He then he told me because of my ratings which are pretty high that I would be receiving a $400 bonus never hearing about anything like this and told him hell yeah. 

He needed to verify me by needing to verify the amount I had in my instant dash card so I told him. Then he instructed me that they needed at least $200 in my direct dash account to give me the $400. Which I didn't have at the time he added that I could add cash through cash app or PayPal to up it. 

At this point I got suspicious and started to call them out they told me if I didn't they could not verify me and I would be deactivated I called bs. I told them there are many ways to verify me included my personal information that I supplied with the company and they should do so he abruptly hung up. 

Upon calling the doordash number back it was deactivated. So what I took from it is somebody made a order for a small item and canceled it upon my arrival using a fake caller ID they named themselves doordash.

Assisted my non native English speaking dasher to finish delivery to my Apt. ,"Definitely one of my most interesting dasher interaction experiences to date lol.
Ordered DD as I'm a bit hungover still. He arrives to my apartment building (easy to get to as there is a pull up spot right off the street (temp spot usually for cars/uhaul of people moving In and out of my building and  one beside mine)

Most dashers park there, come in and bring up to my apt door. This guy I could tell by his name wasn't English native and after a few min pass I look at GPS again and see he's walking up and down the street bs coming into my building he is parked in front of. (Hence I send the text)
He still asks Me to come down. Annoyed I throw on a Hoodie (I was shirtless in bed) and walk down. I meet him out front of my building (he's by his car a few feet away.

I go to grab the food and he says 'no, picture first' I said 'take a photo of me grabbing it from you' he says 'pic at door' 

I walk to front door as I thought that he wanted pic there. No. He waits on me to OPEN door he couldn't read instructions to himself and follows me upstairs back to my apt 😂
Takes pic there *still not even getting unit # which was on the door, he zoomed in on the food by the bottom of door.

I almost reported him, but the poor guy will likely get reported soon enough anyways if he has more of these type of interactions. Customer Assisted doordash for ESL dashers 🤦‍♂️

Half of groceries picked up then assigned new dasher ,"Ordered groceries, the dasher seemed to be taking a long time, eventually half of the items from superstore said found. 

An hour goes by and the same half of groceries were still found, with the rest still pending (all from superstore). My dasher is nowhere near the store, apparently completing other orders, in ANOTHER TOWN? 

I come back downstairs half an hour later to see that we’ve been assigned a new dasher to pick up all of the items. 

So my question is why is there a dasher out there with half my groceries, then decides to do other orders when they had 7 items left to pick up from my order in the same store?

Arby's Admits to Prioritizing Non-delivevery Customers,"A couple nights ago I had a delivery to pick up at Arby's. I arrived, went into lobby and they said it would be a couple minutes before the order was completed. As I sat down to wait (there was absolutely no one in the lobby) I received an additional Arby's offer, which I accepted. I informed the counter employee that the order they had just received was also mine. He said it would take a few more minutes to complete that one. I said ""that's fine"" because, of course, it would take a bit longer. About 3 minutes later, a lady walks in and orders quite a bit of food at the counter. She and I are the only people in the store. After a bit, she gets her food and walks out. I go up to the counter and VERY POLITELY ask why she got her food faster when both my orders had been placed before hers. The manager came up and explained that this was their policy because the customer at home is already waiting on their Doordash delivery and they won't notice so much that it's taking a few extra minutes. However, the customer in the lobby will notice.

"Is it just my area, or does Taco Bell never have good deals?","Taco Bell is half a mile farther than my regular restaurants, so the tip would be a bit higher than those places. But Taco Bell also hasn't had any deals in the past 6 months. So I haven't had them in that long. 

Menu prices of what I'd want to order on my weekly cheat day always far exceed $20, and most Saturdays the other stores have deals going. So I rarely eat Taco Bell. 

I was just wondering if this was a regular thing for DashPassers, or if it's more specific to my area. 

I have a 50% off coupon from DoorDash, limited to $20 off. As much as I would love to use it as an opportunity to eat at Taco Bell, I'm more inclined to use it at Jersey Mike's since I can order a giant and a regular for around $35, but I can save the regular for the next day. Nothing from Taco Bell keeps in the fridge.

Bottom line is I feel like I'm getting a bigger bang for my buck from every store *other than* Taco Bell, even when I have a 50% off coupon for any order from any store.

Long story short, I always in the past have got notifications on every step of the delivery from when the restaurant received my order, from when dasher picked it up, to when dasher is ALMOST here, to when dasher IS here, and then inevitably when they text/call me manually to get in the gate if I’m not already out there waiting. I ONLY got the first 2 of these - when dasher picked it up, and nothing else.

I did NOT get the “dasher is almost here” text (usually when I go down to meet them at the gate, unless I’m working and on a work call, in case I hope and pray it’s unlocked and they come to my door, else I say BRB and run out to pick up my food when they’re here) so I thought I had time to take out the trash quick. I live in a busy beach downtown area. Traffic is shit. Parking is shit. I didn’t think it was unusual not to get the text yet. I left my door open and only had my screen door closed, so anyone who came to my door can see everything in my house.

LO AND BEHOLD to my surprise… in the 3 minutes it took me to go to the dumpster, my food and drink was placed nicely and neatly on my doormat. I checked and got no notifications from DD. The driver even texted me on the website he was here, and I did NOT get notified of that either. He was a G and didn’t open my screen door to do anything bad and left my food thoughtfully.

I can’t even say thank you and apologize because he marked it delivered. I want to double my tip but can’t find out how

Also a reminder that us annoying customers don’t always mean to be annoying 😭 I used to Postmate long ago when that was still around, so I get it…

Slightly new to dashing - why can't we use drive through to pick up orders when there are no other customers? ,"Genuine question -

I live in a super rural area, and i work evenings and nights, so ill often be the only person in a fast food lobby. I went to a sonic and went through the drive through since the entire parking lot was empty and they said I had to go in. 

When I went in, they didn't ask to see my phone for confirmation or anything. They just handed it to me. 
But like, why couldn't this be done through the drive through, only because there's literally ZERO other customers? They did the exact same thing that they would be doing in a drive through, just handed a bag over a counter to whoever I claimed to be. It was so weird. 

Even chick-fil-a here, I could call the store at any time and they will even bring it out, although I never do that. They're usually busier and not open as late so I feel bad having someone come out of the store for me like that.

Before you post your weekly earnings, please factor in how much gas you used, it’s a great way to diminish how much you made and serves as a solid reality check.

"Ordered 2 sandwiches (subway), only got one. ","I'm not expecting some massive turn out, but giving me 1.59 as compensation for a missing sandwich just kinda blows.

I'm generally pretty chill and you could literally shake the shit out of my food or forget and a drink and I'll just blow it off. Whatever.

My dasher texts (through the app) saying they are out of the bread and meat I wanted. I replied within the minute saying what I wanted substituted. Basically any bread and chicken instead of meatballs. I did specify a bread but added ""Flatbread if they have it but any bread works."" Simple enough.

Overall price ,"I know DoorDash drivers do the little things people take for granted, however can you now see why some people give little to no tips at all? I whole heartedly appreciate the drivers, but this is Ridiculous at what is going on. 

I took screenshots of how much the food prices are to pick up from the restaurant, and how much it would be to have delivered via DoorDash. 

The meal went from $12.59 to $16.34 ($3.75 increase).

The 2 count strip went from $4.05 to $5.25 ($1.20 increase).

The small Mac and cheese went from $3.59 to $4.65 ($1.06 increase).

The Parfait went from $4.99 to $6.49 ($1.50 increase).

The meal total for pick up came out to $27.26 while a $0 tip delivery came to $42.78 ($15.52 difference excluding a tip). This is a 64% price increase which is INSANE!!! 

I’m not a driver but I can totally see why people leave 0 tips with a 64% price hike.

My settings are Leave It At My Door, but since I live in a basement unit, I almost always make my way to the sidewalk to meet the dasher. So I’m standing in front of my porch with my dasher map out and I watch as this man drives onto my street, parks half a block away, get out with only his phone and walk around the corner. He comes back to his car and is about to leave when I run up to his car, waving my phone and asking if this is him. He rolls down his window an inch and just says “nah” with wide eyes. After he peels out, I receive a blurry photo of my neighbor around the corners porch (with nothing on it). To be sure, I walked all the way up on their porch and sure enough, nothing there.

Ultimately my order was credited but he got my $4.50 tip and my order. Your days are numbered, Dayira, you absolute donkey.

I have been trying to get more detailed earning statements that include my ABN number, their ABN, their address and other details as I need them for a claim and ATO.

I have asked Doordash support desperately to provide those statements such as UBEReats does (as they have the details and are verified and accepted by both departments), but they refuse to provide them making excuses. They say I am an independent contractor and they re not liable to give me such a document and that I should just use the one I have available in the app. Could anyone help me with this? should I ask somewhere else?

What is up with restaurants saying “Someone already picked up this order.” Then you telling support and support calling the store and telling them to remake it.,"And why is it happening way more often than it has before? 
Is it people being bold enough to confirm pick up and then still unassign? 

The restaurant/fast food places say they make them show confirmation and know they pressed confirm. 
I just don’t understand how these people are keeping accounts. I know it’s a super hard hit on an account to unassign after getting the food so they can’t be doing it more than a few times I would think before they get banned or deactivated. 
My other theory is that they are doing the “airplane mode method”. I’m not tryna give anyone any ideas so if you know you know but that would be the only other explanation.

What are the consequences for drivers refusing to deliver based on tip?,"So here was the situation I dealt with today.
I am a restaurant manager. Today a customer calls in and asks to speak to a manager. She tells me she has been waiting an hour for an order she placed through our website because the delivery keeps getting delayed despite having an assigned driver. 
The way that works is the customer places their order in our site and the delivery is provided via DoorDash. This is so we can run our own promotions and can refund orders if we need to for one reason or another, granted the issue is our fault in said situation. But DoorDash is responsible for anything related to the delivery. 
So I tell her we did make the food and it’s been ready for pick up. So if there is an issue with the delivery she needs to call DoorDash. 
So she hangs up to do so. Then she calls back and tells me apparently the driver has been sitting outside in the parking lot but refusing to pickup the food because he isn’t happy with how much “we” are paying him for it. I say “That makes no sense. We don’t pay him… DoorDash pays him…” and she says “Well he just gave me an attitude and said that because I called him he is gonna stay there as long as he wants.” At this point I am assuming she either stiffed him or was gonna leave a crappy tip. Either way, this isn’t my problem. We made the food and had it ready for the driver. But now SHE wants US to compensate her somehow because even though she gets that DoorDash is responsible for the delivery, we use them as a delivery service so we should take responsibility for this. 
I could have told her this isn’t my problem but I decide to be nice and tell her I will call DoorDash and get THEM to compensate her because we didn’t do anything wrong here, therefore there is no reason for us to swallow the cost. 
So I call DoorDash support and tell them what is happening. The nice lady on the phone tells me to hold so she can call the driver. Sure, no problem. I hold and she gets back to me saying the driver didn’t answer the phone and just cancelled. Coulda done that from the start, buddy. So now they are looking for another driver. I ask the lady “Well are you going to compensate the customer for all this?” She informs me that if someone does, indeed, deliver the food, they will not be refunding her. So I say “Then would you kindly call the customer and explain that to her?” So she puts me on hold again to do so. Lady comes back and says the customer cancelled the order, and that they will be compensating us for the food. Fine by me. I thank her and end the call. Then the customer calls me once more and tells me she is sending someone to pick up the food. Great. We still get paid and she gets a free $200 order. Alls well that ends well I suppose. Sept for the time I had to spend fixing this problem for her because the driver wanted to play games. 
So my question is… do drivers not face consequences for this sort of behavior? I can understand not taking a delivery because of a bad tip or no tip.

"I thought it was a Scam, turned out to be legit!","Accepted a Rusty Taco order for two tacos, Chips & Queso for 9 miles, $14.25 and dropping me into a decent area of my zone. Minutes after accepting DD Support calls. I immediately was on alert as Support very rarely calls us in the middle of an order. Support asks me if I am able to complete the order. I was like yea, why wouldn’t I complete it? He then tells me, this order is for an “Elite” customer (huh?) and if I complete it he will ad $13 to my base pay. I was certain this was a scam and next he would be asking for my account info to “verify” instead he just says Thank you and please keep updated and says good bye.  I hung up not believing a word and continued to drive to the restaurant while calling DD support myself. The agent started laughing when I told her what had transpired stating DD does not call to add money to the base pay, which I knew. I have 14,500 deliveries under my belt. Then as I’m talking to her, I get another incoming call from “DD Support” I told the support agent they were calling back and that this is where they will try to get my account info because they are having trouble depositing the $13 lol. I didn’t answer the call and support didn’t see anything suspicious about the order so she said I could continue with the order if I wanted to and felt safe. Well I carry a Glock so I wasn’t too concerned. And I figured the order would magically get canceled since I didn’t answer when they called back and still get full pay. :) it didn’t get canceled. Dropped off the order it was a leave at the door. And got paid the original $14.25 so I just blew it off. 

That night when I went to transfer my earnings from my dasher direct card to my bank, there was exactly $13 more in my account than what my earnings were for the night??

I looked at my earning tab and sure enough under “Other Pay” it said “ Extra Delivery Payment” $13

This was not an “add on” tip. It was paid from DD! 

So, I have no idea who I delivered to in Xenia, OH but DD paid me well for it. I was doing EBT. the base pay was $7.25, they tipped $7 and DD PAID an additional $13! 

No complaints here! :)

I never respond.

Guy friends have told me to report them when this happens. I agree that I should to stop them from doing it to other girls.

DoorDash Deactivated Customer Acct,"Went to order food and got a weird error and was signed out. Check my email and see my account was deactivated for a “safety violation”… we do not even interact with our driver as we have our order left at the door .  When I called customer support they could not provide any details because there was none other than the account was deactivated for a safety violation… told me they would escalate to a manager, and would receive an email detailing the issue . Been days still havnt heard anything … what possible safety violation could have occurred ? 

Update: after calling three more times and getting hung up on, I finally got a rep that said “ All I can see is that the safety violation was reported by a dasher, sometime last year. “ 

She couldn’t tell me or likely see exactly what it was other than a dasher report. I asked why is it that I get a single unverified report and it takes a year to deactivate the account, why is it that I have reported at least two drivers for flat out stealing my entire order and marking it delivered , or clearly have gone through the bag and yet I’ve had those same dashers several times thereafter … of course I got no response other than, I will escalate this and look for an email within 24/48 hours… this is the exact line I got Monday and it took me calling 3 times on Friday to even get this far …

So DoorDash believes;

-The accused has no right to appeal or even know what the accusation was, if you are a customer you are guilty no matter what.

- Customer complaints on a dasher are not true because the dasher would never do anything wrong.

- That I don’t realize that I was paying less for DoorDash pass every month due to a promo and not the current price , and that they trumped up some fake complaint to deactivate my account so that I would loose the promo and have to pay the going rate again

- when asked , the rep said you can create a new account but with new info… you would need a new phone number , email, and address. A NEW ADDRESS!!!

- when asked is the account ( email, phone, and address) banned for life or just a period of time … answer was for life .

- rep then advised , calling multiple times in a week will not change the answer, and there are no appeal processes, once the answer is final it is final …

The card number IS printed clearly on the back, but the prompt specifically says to scan the front, and no matter how many times I scan the back it says card could not be verified.

Support just keeps telling me to scan again and it will work or to change banks lol. Again the card is totally normal, I use it every day, but I can't seem to get past DD thinking I don't have physical possession of the card when it's right here in my hand.

Dear customers,"Hello.

Dear Ubef Eats customers.


I would like to just inform you dear customers about to search a bit more about how Uber Eats screw up drivers by giving them mostly trips like for example $3 for 20 km or $6 to do 13km and similar to this one. So my question is for you customer, will you drive that distance with your car for that money?


Many great drivers are giving up either with the time where they find out about they actually lose money cuz are doing that few cent deliveries and then after few months they are not afford to maintenance their vehicles or faster, depend of when they will find it out about they actually are not earning enough money. Many of them have no choice because they must work cuz have family, kids, bills to pay, etc. And here I believe you understand their and this situation.

Very often customers also leave negative feedbacks simply with no reason or lie to Uber Eats about the food was stolen, damaged, spilled, not delivered etc, or they decrease the tip amount to screw up the driver, with no reason, why? Mostly to get extra food or money back, and guess who suffer the most? Of course drivers. For example driver accepted the order for $9 to do 13km. So it is $3 from Uber Eats plus $6 tip from the customer. Very often customers decrease thet amount to $0, witn no reason, why? But the problem is Uber Eats is not protecting at all the drivers with this issues.

I bet other delivery companies are not better about it and probably screw up drivers in the same way, cuz why not? Nothing illegal, yes?

So how much money will you have in your pocket after this delivery for $3 or $6 minus gasoline, minus your car usage, not mention about the time which is usually between 30 to 45 min as total delivery time.

Best real and negative complaints against Uber Eats company you can find on many Facebook groups where posts with the screenshot (many of them are from USA but many also from Canada) are publication and then you will know why your order is not delivered fast enough because your order is jumping between driver cellphones and if it's similar to the ones examples mentioned above then that may be the reason. 

I would like to send here big warm hugs for the customers who give drivers reasonable tips because then YOU keep them in this business, not Uber Eats, and God may bless you for that.

All above examples I found out in Facebook Uber Eats posts and from my experience as Uber Eats full time driver. And if you want you can also read a lot about that issues to understand how actually Uber Eats company works with customers. This will help you to answer on your questions maybe about why why my food is so late delivered or maybe other issues.

How do I let a driver know the reason I’m reducing a tip?,"I generally tip 25% + $25 base on top, which I believe is more than what most deliveries pay.

However if a driver does a multi-app drop off after picking up food from one of the highest end restaurants in the region, in order to try squeeze in another $4 on top of a ~$75+ tip, and as a result my food arrives cold, I don’t feel as generous anymore. (I’ll still tip 25%, just remove the $25 on top).

I always pay for priority so this isn’t Uber stacking (though I realize they can still stack on pickup for priority but this is drop off).

EBT Linked To Account. Got Charged All Snap Eligible To Debit Card.,"So, yesterday I placed an order on UberEats for groceries. I have my EBT Card linked, the draft receipt stated partial charge to EBT and Debit before placing order. I placed the order and the app never asked for PIN. It all went to the debit card. 

I asked for help from a customer rep whom checked my account and then transferred me to another representative who wouldn't be available until the next 6 to 12 hours. .

It's been 12 hours now. No call, no email. No response. I go back to the help menu to get assistance again but I'm stuck in the previous transfer mode of chat and there's no one there to respond.

How do I get out of my previous chat?

The problem is people want to have things delivered, and there are so many drivers want to make a decent living and take care of their customers.

Refunding all Uber One fees,"I signed up for a free month of uber one in the UK back in December 2022 and I forgot to cancel it, or at least that’s what I presume happened as I don’t remember signing up for it.

My problem is the Help options in the Uber app have changed ever since and now there is no “uber pass” option so the only way to recover the money appears to be through the “My account has an unrecognised charge” option which I don’t think would work as that applies to one charge at a time.

My order timed out and the app asked me to dispose the food,"It was an apartment complex and I spent about 20 minutes walking around it trying to find the apartment number and it apparently timed out and said the order was canceled and I could dispose the food.

I also asked the gate guard at the gate where the apartment number was located and he did show me on the map where it was but I still wasn’t able to find it. I also asked a neighbor in there if they knew where this specific apartment number was and they were also unsure. Is my account gonna get deactivated? I feel bad cuz it was my first time delivering in such a complex apartment complex and I think I could’ve communicated better with the customer, such as asking if the apartment number that I’m standing right by close to/far from where they are. I’m sure I learned from this and will do better in the future. (if UberEats doesn’t deactivate me hopefully :/)

Why are ice cream orders not priority for stacked orders?,"Not really a genuine question since technically the answer (money) to this question is obvious but this stuff really butters my biscuit. Is it unreasonable to give ice cream orders some type of priority delivery status so the order doesn’t melt before arriving to the customer. There’s many different ways they could go about this quality control problem but I feel like this would be a reliable solution that wouldn’t negatively affect the drivers or customers. 

I’ve heard of people complaining about the importance of an insulated delivery bag for orders like these but the idea that requiring every driver to have one seems expensive and since uber obviously wouldn’t be the one to provide one, it would just make it more difficult for certain drivers. 

I’m sort of just ranting at this point since my ice cream arrived melted after my driver had to make a delivery before mine lol. 

I would like to see who else thinks this concept of delivering ice cream last in a stacked order is silly. It really does seem like Uber has no idea what their customers and employees need/want when you realize issues like this exist tbh.

Order never delivered. UberEats not refunding!!!,"Gonna copy paste down here what I wrote to Uber.

""I ordered from Panda House at 4:37AM on October 17th, 2024. The restaurant was using their own delivery partner, so I added a $12 tip. The order was supposed to be delivered latest by 5:10AM. However, the order was never delivered.

In the course of waiting for more than 90 minutes for the order, I contacted Uber Eats 5 times and the restaurant 12 times. The restaurant, however, never answered - neither mine nor the calls made by Uber Eats executives to the restaurant. It kept going to voice mails and I left them messages. After waiting for more than 90 minutes, when I called UberEats, the last two executives informed me that they have put in the request in the system for cancellation of order on their end so that the merchant can directly do it. They repeatedly told me they will get the order canceled and I should not do it or else I will be charged the cancellation fee. They also put in the record of this in the system and made a note of it, as I was told. 

However, today morning I saw that my order was shown as completed at 9AM. This was absolutely absurd as I never got the order and I had placed the order at 4:37AM. In addition to that, I was told it would be canceled on their end. I was given inconsistent information on several ends. The app kept showing the order was in progress for several hours. 

This is absolutely unprofessional behaviour on the part of the restaurant but also Uber Eats who initially refused to help me, later provided some help but ultimately showed the order was completed without me ever receiving it. This has caused me significant distress as I had ordered food before leaving for work but the food never came and I had go through the stress of calling Uber Eats and restaurant for more than an hour. Uber Eats takes no accountability for several lines of miscommunication on their end. 

I really expect a refund for the order I never received - which was in all actuality also assured by Uber Eats in my last two calls (please listen to the call recordings and also the note made by UberEats upon my calls).""

What UberEats said

""We appreciate you for bringing this concern to us.

I’m Carl, one of the supervisors from the Uber Support team.

I understand how you may feel about this inconvenience, and I took the time to investigate this further thoroughly.

However, your payment for this order isn’t eligible for an adjustment due to the high number of similar adjustments made to your account in the past.

In case you experienced any issues with your delivery, we kindly encourage you to provide your valuable feedback by rating and leaving comments for your delivery person or the merchant through the app. Your feedback is crucial in helping us collaborate with merchants and delivery persons to improve the overall order experience.

We have processes in place to review this type of feedback so your concern hasn't gone unnoticed.

I sincerely appreciate your patience over this entire process. Please let me know if I missed anything or if you still have questions

Have a safe day ahead.""

There have been NO PAST ADJUSTMENTS! I had a similar thing happen to me with a restaurant who used their own delivery guy, where my order never reached me but it showed completed and they unwilling to refund. I let that one slide but NOT THIS TIME! 
I've called UberEats like 10 times in the last 15hours with 20+ min calls and all of them giving cookie cutter responses that since the restaurant isn't picking up calls, they cannot issue refund on their end because their system doesn't allow. Also, they try to find a supervisor to talk to, but nobody is available and they say they will call/email me back but nobody does. 
What should I do now? They are LITERALLY stealing my money and coming up with ways to make it impossible for me to reach them and resolve. I'm so fed up.

Arg - got the wrong order delivered (I'm not Megan!) and support won't do anything,"Mostly posting this to vent. Last night my uber delivery person delivered the wrong order - I wanted Chinese, but instead I got Megan's suspiciously tempura-heavy Japanese order. I dutifully filled out a claim with support, placed another order at my Chinese restaurant, and waited another hour listening to my stomach gurgle. Finally got my food but I sadly didn't find it tasty after the sight and smell of all that tempura.

This morning, uber got back to me saying they won't do anything about the mix-up, and stating that my order is not eligible for a refund or adjustment. I called their support (the highly unpublicized number of 1-800-253-9377), but communicating with their support department is like chatting with a room full of dissociated people that are living on a planet where getting fucked-over is normal.

Getting rid of uber, uber-eats, uber-lame and all other Uber-related apps. Hopefully my credit card will show more sense.

Aside from being over an hour late (which was reflected on the app -- annoying, but fine), a completely different driver arrived than who was pictured on my app with two grocery bags containing part of the order. He said the third and final bag was with another driver who was just behind him and would be coming shortly. I didn't feel safe enough to question or challenge given this was not the person on my app, it was late at night, and I've never had this happen before.

The 'second driver' never appeared. I got refunded the missing items after reporting them missing, no questions asked (via the Uber app). Aside from being incredibly inconvenient (we have no dinner tonight now), I'm a bit wigged out/confused.

Some really great delivery people that I've met.,"I know a lot of us have problems with bad Uber drivers and delivery people, I've had my fair share of issues over the years, but I am so grateful for the awesome ones I get every now and then, such as today. I ordered some food today to make myself feel a little better after an absolutely horrible day, but when she got here she couldn't drive into my yard due to a branch that was hanging low over the driveway to my house that would scratch her vehicle if she tried driving past it. I couldn't go outside to get the order myself because I'm disabled. She could have just canceled the order due to the issues delivering and I wouldn't have even been mad at her about it, but instead she got out and walked all the way to my house to deliver it, which is a pretty good distance. Not only that, when she got to the house and I met her I apologized for the inconvenience and mentioned how the branch probably explained why a previous delivery before her had not been brought to my house despite the delivery instructions, but I hadn't known about the branch. This kind woman went out of her way to bring me the package (it was big) and even broke off the hanging branch so that it wouldn't be in the way anymore. She went above and beyond to help me when she didn't have to and it's this kindness from delivery people, and there have been others who were just as kind, on Uber Eats that has kept me as a member despite the bad deliveries I've had in the past.

DO NOT & I Repeat DO NOT pay out of your pocket for anyone’s order. DoorDash will not reimburse you like they say. ,"Yes, so yesterday while dashing I received an order from a Pappas BBQ for a customer. When I arrived I was informed by management that this order had been picked up already, and that 2 or possibly 3 dashers before me all came in for the same order. I paid for a customers order out of Pocket after I contacted the customer and he said he ordered about 1 hour prior. He was a real cool guy and said if there was anyway I could get the restaurant to remake the order , he would hook me up when I arrive. I said you know what my man I got you. Contacted support and was advised to pay for the order out of pocket, and that I would be reimbursed. After I paid for it I was notified the customer cancelled the order? I paid 13$ out of pocket for the order, and was informed I’d been denied reimbursement via email. The meal was for a Pork Sausage sandwich (I don’t consume Pork), so I left the order with management. Then the customer called me and said he contacted DoorDash just to make sure he wasn’t charged double, & they cancelled me off the order, and he wanted to see if I got a new notification. I told him I don’t think it works that way.. next thing I know in comes another DoorDash driver picking up the new order for the same customer. Somehow someway.. I left the house with the intention of making $ and in the first 30 minutes, losing 13$ lmao. 
Now I see two things.

1. Do not I repeat DO NOT PAY OUT OF POCKET for anyone’s order. Doing Charity work while cool..  is not required at all! It’s best to unassign and simply let them deal with it. It is a waste of time, potential earnings & worst of all, $. Let Doordash and the customer figure it out. Independent contractor.. remember that. 

2. If there is anything wrong with the pickup or order Unassign as fast as possible to hopefully get back on the road to profitability.

I’m so happy I switched from SkipTheDishes and UberEats to DoorDash,"I promise this isn’t a sponsored post lol. UberEats was OK, still kind of annoying with how impossible it was to get a refund, but they only occasionally messed up my ordered. SkipTheDishes was just awful though, I originally liked how it was easier than other apps to be refunded for a missing item from an order, but it got to the point where the drivers were literally messing up like 80% of my orders!! That’s no exaggeration, it was insane. I love ordering food, I’ve done well for myself in life but im also a boring dude who mostly just goes to the gym and chills home, so I’m happy that I can treat myself in this way 2-3 times per week and not worry about it at all. So I would think with how much I have paid for this company over the last 5+ years they would be a little more accommodating? I used to hardly ever have to ask for a refund, and I would NEVER ask for one if the order wasn’t messed up. But it got to the point where the drivers for Skip were just SO BAD that I was having to ask for refunds like almost every time (for me it’s the principle, I refuse to pay for something I didn’t get).

Got Blessed .. customer didn’t even have to do that,"So earlier today I had an order for a Pizza from Pizza Hut to an address about 1 Mile Away. I think the payout was 5.00 . Cool, I got you bro. The manager at this particular Pizza Hut is a pretty cool guy to deal with and I actually enjoy his conversation as I wait. So yeah I decide to take it. Everything is cool I pick it up and head that way. When I arrive I call and confirm I’m at the right address as the apartment was slightly confusing. The guy comes out and asks me “ did you get my tip?”. I say I can’t tell yet but whatever you tipped is just fine, & much appreciated. He says to hold on one second.. goes & gets his wallet, comes back to my car & hands me a 20$ bill. I tell him no no this is much too much. He says to me that God told him to give this to me and to keep the faith. I said “I appreciate it for real.. enjoy your food bro! & God Bless You”. Truly heartwarming moment for me for real. You really never know with people. I mean the guy wasn’t even in some super top notch apartment or $1 Million dollar home. Just thought I’d share this to say that you just never know.

Does Doordash tell shoppers to buy frozen goods first?,"Or are most of my shoppers unaware that once you take things out of the case, like ice cream, that they start melting?

I can understand if maybe someone has never shopped in a modern grocery store, and they don't understand that frozen goods are always last, but I'd expect the app to guide unskilled shoppers in learning the basics of efficient shopping.

At the very least shoppers can copy/paste the list into CoPilot or ChatGPT and ask it to *""Provide the order in which to shop the groceries to ensure freshness and maximum refrigeration""* and it'll tell them. This would be helpful if maybe their parent has always shopped for them, and this is the first time doing something like this and they need some help.

One thing I do not believe is ""your items will be properly refrigerated."" I still go to the store quite a bit and I've maybe once seen a shopper actually putting frozen goods into a thermal bag.

doordash charging my apple pay without authorization,"hi all. im mainly making this as an awareness post because im infuriated.

so, on my doordash account, i have ONE saved payment method. i would also like to note that apple pay is NOT a saved method on my account, i checked the website and the app.

earlier today i used apple pay to pay for a doordash order. DID NOT SAVE MY APPLE PAY. today was our renewal date for our dashpass and apparently the one saved card on the account declined.

so what you'd expect to happen is they cancel the subscription right?

nope.

somehow, WITHOUT my authorization, my debit card linked to my apple pay was charged. my apple wallet shows that it was paid for with apple pay.

i called doordash support to ask for an explanation and for confirmation this wouldn't happen again as i'm not the main user of the account and i do not agree to be paying for the dashpass.

after a lot of back and forth, the support person basically told me there's nothing she can do and my only option is to unlink my card from MY apple pay to prevent it from being charged again.

they straight up told me that to prevent doordash from putting unauthorized charges on my cards, i need to go out of my way to remove cards from my apple wallet that i use regularly because they have no way to 'unlink' it and neither do i.

which by the way, i had no knowledge that my apple wallet was being ""linked""?? nowhere did it say that. the reason i was even using it is because i didnt want my card linked to the account and apple encrypts cards you put in your wallet.

i told them that if any other unauthorized charges get put on my apple wallet by doordash im filing a chargeback because i should not have to get rid of my apple wallet to prevent unauthorized transactions 🤷

Can you have DoorDash stop offers coming to you for people in other towns?,"I live and dash in a college town, for some reason our Dash area is pretty big and get offers for much smaller towns that are like 10-15 miles away. I hate dashing after 6PM because people in those town get home from work, and seems like all the offers I get are $5-$8 offers to deliver to those towns 10-15 miles away. Not worth my time, and declining them all is going to royally screw up my AR rate. So because of that, I typically just stop dashing at 6pm to avoid those stupid lowball offers going that distance to those town.

If I were to contact DoorDash Support, and tell them I don't want any offers from people in those specific towns coming to me, can they put a filter in place to stop those from coming to me?

How DD phones work ,"
Hey, 

Long story short, after a delivery I messaged my dasher and complimented him and asked for his number. 

He called me rather then texting in the app I guess so no trail professionally and showed interest/complimented as well and we spoke for a few minutes. Lots of laughs/flirting etc. we agreed to text and set something up. 

I text that number but I think since it’s attached to the app/me it doesn’t allow things to go through after the delivery’s over? I believe they do use their actual phones but DD spoof the number maybe? It’s was his first couple days dashing so I’m assuming he didn’t know that and didn’t give the run around lol. 

He was pretty into me humbly, compliments was excited, laughing etc etc. mind you he called me, could’ve just ignored my message. 

Is there a way I could actual contact him without the auto block on the door dash number “this number cannot be used anymore” etc

As that family stepped away, the dude stepped in front of me, showing just the phone, “I have a pickup.” I’ve been sick so I spoke up calmly, “uh yeah, I ALSO have an online order to pick up and it’s ready, right there.”

I'm anxious.  Carrier Pickup location is 1 hour away from my home. What happens if no driver accepts the job?  ,"Yesterday (a day after I made my order) I found out that petsmart uses DoorDash. There is no option to tip on my checkout page so I learned that DoorDash offers a higher pay for these orders. Thank you to those who commented and informed me on my post yesterday!! 

Anyway, One time, out of all my door dash orders,  I made an order for my own food  and my order just sat there because two drivers didn't want to go to my community since there's long lines lol. But this only happened with one order. I just picked it up myself at the food place, no big deal. 

Now I'm fearing that somebody won't want to pick up this order? The pick up location is one hour away from my home. I had no idea Petsmart does this and why they do this. 

I'm an anxious person and this cat food is prescription food called urgent care... so I do need it urgently! Lol. (The only option to buy this food was to have it shipped. My store was out of stock) 

Is the pay bad where it's not worth to deliver an hour away?

Dashers stealing food,"For the past two weeks I’ve been ordering food more regularly due to my schedule. I’ve had my orders stolen three times in a week. I live in Canada and I don’t know if anyone else is having this issue. I don’t know if they just collect all the tips and try to cash out quickly so they don’t have to do any actual work. It’s genuinely disappointing since I switched from Uber eats due to its rising costs. 

One order tonight got stolen twice. The first time I ordered I ended contacting support and telling them this dasher had been idling in an area a few miles away from the actual store for more than 10 minutes and I started getting suspicious. When I contacted support they hesitated to even give me a new dasher until I pressed that they do since I had proof which I sent. Support told me it was grouped in one reply and then saying it was picked up, one of which was true assuming they can see on their end that my dasher picked up the food from the restaurant. I know what the grouped order timeline looks like, they usually tell you they’re completing another order but this time it was just saying “picking up your order”. And I was starting to get suspicious of if they were going to tamper with it. When they assigned someone new I was relieved until it came time to open the door and it wasn’t there, I even looked around at the neighbours. I knew I should’ve been suspicious by the time they sent a black screen as “picked up” picture proof. And obviously no delivery photo. 

Most of the time I give dashers grace when they sit in a place for a long time since there’s that double dash time in which they probably don’t want to pick up an order and find out later that I wanted something else but these days I honestly don’t even trust that thought anymore. 

And in case some people say I didn’t tip enough, I gave them 25% and the place was close by.

The dashers mark waiting but refuse to take the order!,"As a restaurant owner, it’s frustrating when a Dasher hits ‘waiting’ but never actually comes to take the order. We prepare everything on time, ready to go, but sometimes the Dasher marks themselves as ‘waiting’—which usually means they’re close or at the restaurant—but they don’t actually show up. Some dasher literally just park outside and wait to get unassigned. This ends up delaying not only that order but also affects other customers who are waiting. I’ve tried contacting customer service and hoping they get unassigned asap, but it’s such an inconvenience for our staff and impacts our service. Has anyone else dealt with this? Any advice on how to get a new Dasher assigned faster when this happens?

Potential Scam? ,"Don’t know if I’m overreacting or am justified in being cautious, so I wanted to get other drivers opinion on this. 

Accepted this order as it was only two items plus good tip (over $1 per mile). However, once I got into the store I noticed one of the items was a $25 Starbucks gift card.

My mind went to the customer claiming they didn’t receive the gift card or that it was empty then blame me for it. I asked one of the workers at Walgreens about it and she said she had never sold one through DoorDash, but the process would be the same as a normal customer.

Dashlink Tips,"1. You can decline dashlink offers and still get dashlinks. You keep your spot on the waiting list and you have to wait maybe 15 seconds to a minute, but another offer will come over.

2. It doesn't matter where you are. I've been up to 30 miles away from the dashlink warehouse and have gotten orders. As long as you're on the waitlist and on an active dash, you'll get a dashlink 

3. You don't need to be dashing in the area where the dashlink warehouse is located. I've been dashing 30 miles away, 2 areas away, and received dashlinks 

4. If you're on the 7am waitlist, keep calling and ask to be put on the 12:05 midnight waitlist. You'll get a few agents that don't know what you're talking about, will say it's automated, will tell you to check your preferences, will say they're forwarding your concern, but hopefully you'll get through to the right agent.

This is for the people who can’t decide,"Hi! Before I start, I wanna say, yes the problem is with uber. The reason I’m posting it is for one, awareness and two, for those like me who use both apps because we can’t choose one app only. I used to use only DoorDash but I started using uber a year or two later because the coverage area was much bigger. But after this, I’m canceling uber one, and forever staying with DoorDash.  Never had a problem like this with dd, but uber? It seems like every time I order it’s either, no problem, problem solved w refund if necessary, but mostly problem not solved and you don’t get a refund. I’d understand if it was because I didn’t like it but THAT SHEET MADE ME SICK. But I guess they just wanna pocket the money since it was a big amount. Anyways, let’s start the story ish.

Yall, so I ordered from ue yesterday, I got some sushi from a place that's supposed to be high rated, well.... I got food poisoning from the sushi, :|| I probably shouldn't have continued to eat it but this is like 150$ worth of sushi.
The first red flag was that when it arrived the rice was normal
temperature but the fish was hot (it's not supposed to)
The second red flag was that it was slimy and tasted past date.
The third red flag was the rice. I've made sushi in the past and have gone to many places before and ate sushi made by Japanese who immigrated here. They've taught me the secret to making rice lol. But the rice was most probably not washed. It was either undercooked or overcooked. The overcooked left a literal layer of gew on my fingers.

Anyways, so I contacted ue customer service. Ive never really had a problem with them, but yesterday and today? Oh my lawd. These hands about to be thrown. If it was 20$ I wouldn’t be so mad about not getting a refund. 20$ is a lot, but at the end of the day, I’d rather not fight it. But this came to a total of 170$. It made me incredibly sick, and am still going through it rn. I screenshotted the convo, but from my understanding is that ue doesn’t give a damn. They keep copy pasting the same thing just changing the words, and I snapped. Now they aren’t responding anymore.

Yall, am I overthinking this? Or is UE quite literally screwing me over.

Cheat Sheet for Offer Worthiness,"
How to Use This Chart:

1.	Calculate Earnings per Mile:
	•	Divide the dollar amount by the total miles in                                            the offer, then compare it with the chart to find the corresponding hourly rate.

2.	Interpret the Hourly Rate:
	•	The hourly rate from the chart shows your estimated profit, excluding return miles.

3.	Add Return Miles if Necessary:
	•	If the drop-off is far from home or a busy area, ask your GPS or voice assistant for the extra distance and add it to the total miles before calculating earnings per mile.

4.	Adjust for Time Flexibility:
	•	If time isn’t an issue, subtract $0.70 from your dollars-per-mile calculation to estimate profit per mile.

While yes, there’s a time limit for accepting offers, this can be done quickly with voice assistants like Siri.

Example:

•	Offer: $10 for 5 miles to deliver to 13 Dasher Ln.

•	You: “Hey Siri, how far is 13 Dasher Ln from home (or a busy area)?”

•	Siri: “It’s 7 miles.”

•	You: “Hey Siri, what’s $10 divided by 12 miles?”

•	Siri: “It’s $0.83 per mile.”

•	You check the chart, see it’s equivalent to around $7/hour, and promptly decline.

The DoorDash Dasher reward system has minimal impact on actual earnings, so you can safely ignore acceptance rate concerns when aiming for profitability. Through careful analysis, I’ve found the rewards provided are negligible and don’t offset the losses from low dollars-per-mile offers. In many cases, you’ll incur higher vehicle expenses than the income from such offers. Additionally, it’s common for acceptance rates to drop significantly throughout the year, either due to repeated low-value offers or app glitches related to connectivity.

I hate customers that just won't respond.... just left order in random spot...,"Picked up an order dashing this evening that was ""hand it to me"" order. Only an address was given, so assumed it was just a house. Arrive only to find that it's a 2 unit duplex. Customer gave no indication in the instructions or anything which unit he lived in. Sent a message asking, no response. Tried calling, didn't answer. 

It was only 2 units so figured I'll just ring the doorbell for each one and see who it belongs to. Nobody came to the door at either unit. In case the doorbell didn't work, knocked on the door of each unit. Nobody ever came to the door of either unit. Waited 30 seconds, knocked on both doors again nothing. Tried calling once more, didn't answer.

I made sure to verify I was in fact at the correct address, 100% I was. So just said screw it and just picked a porch and left it and marked it complete.

"What triggers the ""youve been having issues with your orders"" message?","I order Doordash 4-5 times a month. I very rarely have issues -- the last time I reported one was over a year ago and, in my time using Doordash, I've reported 6 total issues. I ignore small things like an item worth a dollar or two missing.

The most recent one was today -- I had a small order (a 12 pack of soda and a pack of frozen sausage biscuits). I had selected substitutions for the soda, but was brought something completely unrelated (Arizona Green Tea). So I reported the issue.

Arguably, I shouldn't have, but I only received a half-refund (I'm guessing this is due to this message popping up) But I'm wondering -- does anyone know what it takes to trigger this? I don't think 6 issues over the past 3 years is too much, especially given the 4-5 orders a month.

I know the common answer on here is ""lol you're trying to take advantage"" and I don't know how I can prove otherwise other than say that I certainly have NOT done that. I tip 20% or higher on all my orders so I don't think its drivers trying to screw me.

GPS wont take you to my house,"Im sort of at my wits end. I moved to the place I live now over the summer. I order way too much doordash, Im aware (at least three or four times a week, sometimes more. I need to cut down but thats not the point)

My new place is in the woods, basically. My 'driveway' is not off the road that my house address is on, and if you use GPS it tries to take you to just the closest house on that street. my pin in the app is correct, but the gps just cant figure out how to get you there without telling you to walk through the woods. 

I have detailed instructions on how to get to my house from the main road in my delivery instructions. 

When a dasher picks up my order, I send them a map with my driveway outlined in red from the dasher app, from google maps, anything I can think of that would make it easier for them to find.

I would say 85-90% of Dashers can figure it out but there are some that just dont read instructions or dont look at their messages and will either cancel for being 'unable to find my house', or just straight up leave it at a random house.

Today was the last straw when a dasher told me to go out and find where she left my food myself and stop inconveniencing dashers by not fixing my address in the app. The issue is theres nothing to fix! My pin is exactly where my house is! 

Am I the asshole customer here? Should I just not even bother and come to terms with the fact that I can no longer use delivery apps? Is there anything else I should/could be doing to make dashers lives easier?

Can I still not sort restaurants by distance?,"Hi. I last used DoorDash 5 years ago when I won some credits. The free food was nice and all, but it was such a pain to find restaurants because I couldn't sort by distance. I've since been using Uber Eats and GrubHub, and just returned to DoorDash yesterday because of a promotional offer.

**Can I still not sort restaurants by distance, especially for pickup orders?** I don't want to walk too far away to pick up food due to lack of time, so when the results on both the desktop web browser and app do not allow me to sort by distance, I have to search for every restaurant I don't recognize on Google Maps just to see how far away they are from me.

I'm in San Francisco, where there are literally over 100 restaurants within a mile from me, so the results are pretty overwhelming if I can't figure out which restaurants are nearby. Right now, the top result after sorting by Pickup is 4 blocks away, and the second result is 13 blocks away.

Sorry to rant, but I am so sick of doordash. There has to be a better way to vet drivers for these types of orders.

Fine, order from the last backup that is still open. Dasher gets assigned, sweet (basically same order, small dinner, 2.8 miles, $12 tip).

Uber eats more expensive than local delivery,"So, it feels like these days, it's much cheaper to use a restaurant's local delivery guy via the website rather than uber eats bc of all the fees that uber charges + the markup that restaurants need to add to their prices on the app.

Alcohol Deliveries stopped coming in. What do I do now?,"In my app under preferences where I choose the types of deliveries I want to take everything is approved in green except alcohol - it says needs attention in red. Upon tapping on it, it gives me the option to resolve. I tap resolve and it says pending background check. It’s like it’s stuck. It’s been that way forever. 

I’ve uploaded my alcohol certificate months ago along with my drivers license. They’ve done several background checks and all are clear. It gives me no other options. When I go into my documents/view all documents it also says needs attention under alcohol. I tap it and it says on that screen background check in review. I’ve been delivering alcohol for over a year at least. My last one though was 10/14/24 and I haven’t received a single alcohol delivery since which is what got me to looking through the app. 

I’ve chatted with at least 10 agents each and everyone have no clue what they’re doing. One told me alcohol delivery is not available in my city. The other said I need to opt in. Another told me I wasn’t invited. Another told me you can’t deliver alcohol in Uber. I mean it just goes on and on. 

I called today. After going through three agent I got a guy who now tells me to delete the app which I guess I’ll try. He said on his end it shows I’m in for alcohol deliveries and I should be receiving them.

How to deal with scamming customers using “meet at door”,"I have an effective solution for customers who are suspicious or may attempt to scam by claiming deliveries weren't delivered to their address.

These customers often mark their delivery as ""meet at door"" and request to have the package left there at their door. This creates a situation where you have no proof of delivery since photo verification isn’t available until after the timer expires. Who is going to wait seven minutes in scorching heat / or in a storm / bad weather. 

To address this, I've started using a timestamp camera app. I’ll take a photo of the package at the delivery location, copy the coordinates from the app and send them to the customer. I inform the customer that the photos have been taken and will be forwarded to support as proof of delivery, given their request to leave the package at the door. This most likely scares them and makes them think twice before reporting a delivery as not delivered. 

I understand some customers will have their notes set by default and forget to change them. What’s wrong is some of these customers may be scamming. 

One store told me about a guy who frequently marked his deliveries as missing items or undelivered, making him a real headache for them. They had to contact support multiple times to receive payment after he was refunded.

Since we’re in a small city (Dunedin, New Zealand), I encountered this customer often. He would set his delivery to ""meet at door"" and then ask me to call when I arrived, only to tell me to leave the package at the door. I called him and warned him to stop reporting missing items emphasising that it jeopardised people’s jobs. I also mentioned I would report him to support. Now I never see him on Uber, but I still get deliveries to him on DoorDash — it's quite the laugh!

30+ min hot food deliveries...,"IDK why it's becoming more common to have a delivery that takes a MINIMUM of 25-30 min from the restaurant to the drop off location, but this morning was just... wrong.

6 times in a row, I was offered to pick up Nico's Pizza at 4:15-4:30am. It was exactly the same offer, each time increasing in price. The first offer was $4.19. Then $4.90. Followed by $6.23. I finally accepted it at $10.50 after so many declines...

Turns out, the customer ordered an XXL thin crust with 10+ toppings... Receipt total was $43.50 for a single pizza... WTF?!?

Anyway, I went into the pizza shop with my 16"" pizza bag, only to find a 24"" box - literally two feet square!

After sliding it into my back seat, I looked at the map to discover what was offered as a 10 min, 6 mile drive for $10.50 was now a 15 mile 39 min drive.

I delivered it. It was a ""meet at door"" guest who wasn't home or had gone to bed after ordering. I waited the 8 min until the arrival timer counted down, knocking and phoning, texting and knocking again... No answer. Left the pizza in the 40 degree cold on their patio table.

Lately, I've had IHOP, Dennys/MeltDown/BurgerDen, Panda, and Pizza Hut deliveries that - even in the best of situations with zero traffic and hitting every green light - would take a minimum of 20 min. During rush hour or school days? 30-40 min. Add train delays: 60 min...

I know I should never have taken that pizza order. But I wanted to start my day off with $10.

Sadly, they reduced the tip to $1 because I left it out in the cold. Not my fault... FFS

"Order says arrived, but never got the order, and driver says it was cancelled","Sorry if this is lengthy but I'm kind of worried as I spent quite a bit on this order. Essentially, I ordered something today, but the driver said they didn't know the place well and went to the road beside the road I was on, so I proceeded to ask them if they could go to where I was, which is less than a minute away. They said they didn't know that street, so I asked if they had another contact method and sent them an Uber map screenshot of the place I was at, with the road name. A few minutes go by and the driver was not heading anywhere near the place I circled, and soon, I see the driver heading towards the opposite direction, and suddenly it says delivered.

"Help please, I have a problem with a driver and IDK what to do","Hey y'all, I'll start by saying I have spent my entire life either in food service/delivery or retail/customer service, so I have never and will never be ""one of those"" customers. I do not treat any service person badly, no matter how much I want to sometimes, because I have experienced that plenty and it sucks.

  
I developed multiple sclerosis many years ago, and it's gotten to the point that some days I cannot manage to get around at all, even in my own house. I am in a wheelchair, and days like today, it takes me about 10 minutes to get from my bedside to the living room 15 feet away because my body was so weak and numb, I make it maybe a foot at a time and stop.

  
So, I order food occasionally from Uber Eats. Never had too much of a problem, some forgotten items (fairly often, but I don't blame the drivers, what are they gonna do about it when the bag is sealed), some errors from the restaurant, that kinda stuff.

  
But this one driver, first time I've seen her come up on an order I placed about 2 weeks ago, she left my food 1/2 mile down the road, on the side of the road, because ""there's hella cars out front and it's too dark to be down here without cell service"". I live exactly 1 mile off the main road in a city of about 60,000 people, but it is an old neighborhood with no streetlights so it can be dark down here, and cell service can be spotty starting about 1/4 mile before you get to my house.

  
The things is... there were no cars anywhere other than the ones parked in their normal driveways around at my neighbors, and IDK what she was talking about, or what it was that upset her so much. I even asked my neighbors a few doors down if they were having a party or something, since I cannot see every house from my house, but no, everything was quiet. Even the neighbors across the street, who usually \*do\* have parties, their house was dark.

  
Don't get me wrong, I am not knocking her for wanting to be safe at all, which is why I didn't leave a bad review or anything; I didn't want to contribute to her ever feeling obligated to go into a situation where she felt it was not safe because she was afraid to lose income or something.

  
However, she just picked up my order tonight, and my blood pressure is spiking because I'm not only unable to leave the house today, but I am also sick with something and I'm barely managing to sit up at my desk to work (WFH thank goodness).

  
I Googled but got conflicting answers on this: is there some way I can ask Uber to block this driver from my orders, if she ends up leaving it down the road again like that?",,,UberEATS,10,7,0.89,Anonymous,n,1,0,,,help please problem driver idk,hey yall ill start say spend entire life either food servicedelivery retailcustomer service never never one customer treat service person badly matter much want sometimes experience plenty suck develop multiple sclerosis many year ago gotten point day manage get around even house wheelchair day like today take minute get bedside living room foot away body weak numb make maybe foot time stop order food occasionally uber eats never much problem forget item fairly often dont blame driver gon na bag seal error restaurant kinda stuff one driver first time ive see come order place week ago leave food mile road side road there hella car front dark without cell service live exactly mile main road city people old neighborhood streetlight dark cell service spotty start mile get house thing car anywhere one park normal driveway around neighbor idk talk upset much even ask neighbor door party something since see every house house everything quiet even neighbor across street usually party house dark dont get wrong knock want safe didnt leave bad review anything didnt want contribute ever feel obligate go situation felt safe afraid lose income something however pick order tonight blood pressure spike im unable leave house today also sick something im barely manage sit desk work wfh thank goodness google get conflict answer way ask uber block driver order end leave road like,0,0,help please problem driver idk hey yall ill start say spend entire life either food servicedelivery retailcustomer service never never one customer treat service person badly matter much want sometimes experience plenty suck develop multiple sclerosis many year ago gotten point day manage get around even house wheelchair day like today take minute get bedside living room foot away body weak numb make maybe foot time stop order food occasionally uber eats never much problem forget item fairly often dont blame driver gon na bag seal error restaurant kinda stuff one driver first time ive see come order place week ago leave food mile road side road there hella car front dark without cell service live exactly mile main road city people old neighborhood streetlight dark cell service spotty start mile get house thing car anywhere one park normal driveway around neighbor idk talk upset much even ask neighbor door party something since see every house house everything quiet even neighbor across street usually party house dark dont get wrong knock want safe didnt leave bad review anything didnt want contribute ever feel obligate go situation felt safe afraid lose income something however pick order tonight blood pressure spike im unable leave house today also sick something im barely manage sit desk work wfh thank goodness google get conflict answer way ask uber block driver order end leave road like,5,225,"{'neg': 0.406, 'neu': 0.099, 'pos': 0.495, 'compound': 0.2263}","{'neg': 0.162, 'neu': 0.698, 'pos': 0.141, 'compound': -0.6895}",0.495,0.406,0.099,0.2263,0.141,0.162,0.698,-0.6895,0

They said to return the order for pay and a 1/2. Which was 6$ total, I asked if I could just keep it, they said no.

BC legislation against deactivation ,"About a month ago my Doordash account got deactivated, for prolonged pickup or delivery time, which is a new policy in BC to go against the minimum earnings like Doordash did in California for prop 22. BC legislation enforced minimum earnings, but also has protection against deactivation. Companies are no longer allowed to suspend indefinitely, much like Doordash does with the 90 days between appeals, instead there is to be a maximum of 14 days before the account is either reactivated or fully terminated. 

Also, there is the policy that states that a deactivation notice must be received 72 hours before the worker is unable to accept orders. I got deactivated while I accepted an order, as soon as I accepted the order my app went unresponsive, and a few hours later I got an email I was deactivated. So there is two laws that Doordash broke while deactivating me and upholding the deactivation for so long.

Prior to deactivation I had no violations on my ratings tab, let alone the ability to dispute the violations, so in my mind the deactivation was unfair and unexpected. 

My question is if any one knows who to contact as a gig worker in BC to report the violations that Doordash has committed, and to get some protection or representation. Support won't even clarify why the deactivation was upheld, all they told me is upon review a violation occured. When I heard that I was very upset, because does that mean I got deactivated for one violation? I called multiple times to get the details and the support team tells me sorry there are no details for the violation, but they want me to trust them that the right decision was made. Funnily enough, I didn't even try to extend times for additional pay, there were just grocery store orders that had long wait times, as prior to legislation I think I received a total of 2 violations.

Regarding Tips,I have been ordering doordash for a while. I normally tip $2 a mile. However I'm starting to see my food arrive or even being picked up an hour after I place my order. Due to this I am looking at raising the base amount I tip per mile. However I am looking for feedback from the doordash community. On how much I should raise it to. I have been thinking 2.50 to 3 dollars a mile. I understand inflation is getting to the point where people sometimes won't deliver. I don't know if people are refusing to pick up my orders or if they are several dashers that are just greedy.

Almost got into a physical fight with customer.,"I had been having a bad evening delivering, bad tips all around.

Was waiting for an order with a three dollar tip -- when I get text from customer, ""where's my food, why isnt it ready yet?"" I had only been there about five minutes.

I replied,"" I don't know, I don't work here."" (I know, not the best response).

They responded, ""don't get an attitude with me.""

I didn't respond. The food came, and I headed out. Turns out it was for a truck driver waiting in a parking lot. As soon as my head lights lit him up outside his rig, I knew there was going to be trouble.

I stepped out, walked, and handed him the order. ""have a nice night,"" I said.

He looked in the bag, and then back at me, ""you need to watch how you talk.""

That set me off, ""I'll talk however the f I want."" I started to back away towards my car. Making sure I was in silhouette, and that he was blinded by the head lights. He started to follow me towards my car.

""How about I beat your ass?"" he said.

""F you man."" I replied getting into my car.

""Get out of that car p\*#sY.""

""Sorry man, I'm an adult, and this isn't a school yard.""

5 minutes later I get a call from a very rude woman saying she never got the food! She started asking me to go back to the guy and get the food back! I said, he’s your neighbor, go confront him. She said “No, I DONT live in an apartment building. There was no one else home.” 

Normally I would take the blame and assume I went to the wrong house in a situation like this, but what makes me suspicious is the fact that the delivery instructions specifically said to go to APARTMENT B. So why would she say that?

Dasher Theft (Food),"Hi everyone,  I need some advice on how to report a driver for stealing food.
Earlier this afternoon, I placed a Pizza Hut order for my elderly father to be delivered to his apt. The whole process took about an hour. The automated system sent me a text that said the driver was on the way and a second meessage  that confirmed that the order was handed to the recipient.
And it gave a phone number to call to reach the driver. So after I confirmed with my father that no food was given to him or left at the door, I called the number with my father on 3-way.
The Dasher says that she ""didn't see any apartment number"" on the delivery ticket and would be right back. Almost two hours later, nothing. Called pizza Hut and the worker says, yeah, we gave it to door dash and it's been gone.

 I got credits refunded and placed this order a whole day later, i placed it at 4pm, it has constantly been bouncing dashers, either popeyes never made my food, first dasher stole it or they lost my food, either way if its been made which it very well should have, its gonna be old, cold and probably dry too.

 The problems are so consistent on doordash, i guarantee once this order finally gets canceled or delivered, doordash wont believe me because of the consistent compensation.

[Update] Doordash refused my refund. What?,"previous post here. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/s/Xx48yZKGKh

I took 2 steps and anyone having issues with Doordash i urge to do the same. 

1) I filed a consumer complaint with the FTC. While the feds do not settle individual complaints, they do keep it on file and use them if a pattern emerges as part of any investigation. 

2) I filed a consumer complaint with my states Attorney General office. in my state (Maryland) its the AG office that handles consumer complaints, but other states, countries, etc may handle it differently so research your municipality.

I received a letter back from the AG office. They initiated contact with Doordash to settle the issue. It instructed me to contact the office again if I don't hear back from Doordash within a month. That month is up at the end of this week and so far nothing from DD. 

Remember, our governments are here to work for us, so may as well take advantage of their services.

Tired of platinum ,"When the program started six months ago it really was good. But in the last  six weeks just horrible orders. If it’s not 9 for 12 miles it’s 5 for 2. Long gone are the big restaurant orders with a 40 tip going 6 miles. I am now only taking 1.50 per mile. I’ll take the 5 for 2 miles but just to keep my ar from dropping more quickly. 
My ar  was always hovering around 98.  Now still high but down a point or two every day. (I know “poor baby “)
I only work lunch and dinner so dash now while nice isn’t the be all. 
My point is I feel like I am getting killed with a thousand cuts by dd. I just hate the feeling after keeping these stats for this long it will end with me scrounging around for dash time and still getting the same bad orders. 
Seriously cherry picking uber and grub hub. Now 60 percent of my money comes from those two. It was 20 percent. (Mainly uber eats)
Just seems a shame that a former top dasher and now high stats platinum gets treated like the red headed step child. 
So the point of this rant( besides being cathartic) is just to hear like kind of stories if ya got them. Maybe how it ended for you order wise.

When I texted the customer through the dasher app asking who it was it sent back the standard text message confirming I was connected to the customer. I informed the Wendys staff that it was likely a scam and proceeded to make the delivery.

When i arrived at the drop off location it was an apartment complex and no unit number was listed in the app when i attempted to call the customer they picked up and identified themselves as dasher support. They tried to tell me that the order was placed with a fraudulent credit card and that they needed to verify my account information. I played along at first but refused to give them any personal information, saying that i would only provide the information in person. They began to stutter and stumble a bit realizing that i had caught on. 

They then instructed me to wait an hour for the door dash support person to show up. (LOL) I then proceeded to drop off the frosty at the apartment sign at the entrance which had the adress on it.

All I got was her sandwich and the soup. I said ok stuff happens. We got a refund for my sandwich.....hopefully it comes back. We then ordered thru the taco bell app that uses doordash.

Standard fare outrage… with a twist,"After seeing probably hundreds of interactions in this subreddit just like these but never experiencing it myself, it finally happened. 

I ordered entirely too much pasta, a side of alfredo sauce and a slice of chocolate cake. I used the new 50% off coupon for connecting a lyft account. 

I watched my ETA shift later and later and later as “Auren” approached, figuring traffic was heavier than expected. Then I saw him pass my exit and keep driving 10-15 minutes in the wrong direction on the freeway. He turned around eventually so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and considered that he may have just missed the exit, but I was starting to suspect that at minimum he was multi-apping. 

Then when he got into the neighborhood I watched him drive in actual circles. He passed my place 3 or 4 times. Finally his dot settled around the corner and I got a phone call. 

All I heard was “no speak english” followed by a quick string of Spanish. Since the app has an auto translator I just hung up and used the chat. He never responded to a single message. After watching his dot continue to circle more I contacted support. 

I’m pissed they left me no choice but to cancel since it felt like handing this joker free $50 worth of food, but at least I could reorder with a full refund. Then I realized that, of course, the coupon I’d used on my stolen order was long gone.

I cancelled because the restaurant was closed and called support. Uber still increased my cancellation rate. WTF? (Uber driver) ,"I've been delivering for UE for about 2 years now. Just last night I accepted an order from a fast food place and the store was closed. So I called Uber support and told them the issue. They told me ""don't worry this won't affect your cancellation rate."" They cancelled the order and it increased my cancellation rate. WTF? Has this happened to anyone else?

This isn't the first time this happened to me. It also happened about a week ago.

I called support again and told them the issue. They said a lot of drivers were calling in about this and that they thought it was a glitch. They said they'd report the issue to the programming team.

Now I'm really confused about Uber's cancellation rate policy. If we cancel because a restaurant is closed does this increase our cancellation rate now? Does this also apply to orders that were picked up by someone else?

As a driver I can't control if the restaurant closes early or if someone else picks it up. It seems like bullshit that drivers would be penalized for these issues. If Uber sticks with this policy then the only thing I can do is be really picky and take only orders from really reliable restaurants in my area. This is mostly big name fast food and a few Chinese places. TBH I'll probably just use other gig apps more.

In the end I think this is going to hurt the UE customers the most. If anyone orders from the wrong restaurant, then no one will want to accept the order. They'll get the order late or not at all.

UPDATE - It happened again tonight. Took at Taco Bell order and the store lost the order in their system after 10 minutes. I called support and they told me it ""wont affect my rating."" They cancelled this one order and it increased my cancel rate by 2%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF???!!! I'm focusing on other apps now. Uber Eats is a mess!

Done with DoorDash after a 57.75 % up charge (pre tip) ,"Life is hectic today, so I decided to order out for the family. Went to order Chick-fil-A on DoorDash, and the total was $64.52 (pre-tip).

Instead, I went to pick it up in person, and it was $40.90.

UPDATE FROM LAST POST,"i posted this last night and definitely was not expecting it to blow up like it did!! i’ve seen some people arguing in the comments and just wanted to gives some updates and additional information 

1. i definitely will take the mileage into considering when tipping for next time! however, my maps shows it’s only a 5.5 mile drive. so yes it was 10-15 minutes, but it wasn’t using a lot of gas 

2. the dasher had ALREADY picked up my order and driven to my neighborhood. i would’ve understood if he cancelled it automatically, but he waited until he was only minutes away from my house. he sat in a parking lot while he messaged me waiting for more money. he had already made the drive before even messaging me 

3. yeah it took me more than 3 minutes to respond 

4. i got a full refund and did a one star rating for the driver ",customer,Tip,doordash,282,867,0.92,Anonymous,y,1,0,,,update last post,post last night definitely expect blow like ive see people argue comment want give update additional information definitely take mileage consider tip next time however map show mile drive yes minute wasnt use lot gas dasher already pick order driven neighborhood wouldve understood cancel automatically wait minute away house sit parking lot message wait money already make drive even message yeah take minute respond get full refund one star rating driver,0,0,update last post post last night definitely expect blow like ive see people argue comment want give update additional information definitely take mileage consider tip next time however map show mile drive yes minute wasnt use lot gas dasher already pick order driven neighborhood wouldve understood cancel automatically wait minute away house sit parking lot message wait money already make drive even message yeah take minute respond get full refund one star rating driver,3,71,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}","{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.773, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.8271}",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.173,0.054,0.773,0.8271,1
