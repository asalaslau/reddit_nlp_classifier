1732272820.0,"Open Letter to DoorDash: Unjust Deactivation, Earn by Time Exploitation, and Denied Appeal","I’m posting this open letter to DoorDash because I believe the public deserves to know what’s happening behind the scenes. Recently, my account was unjustly deactivated for “prolonging pickups and deliveries,” but this claim is false.

Here’s the truth:
1️⃣ I was never given any prior warnings about delays.
2️⃣ Delays were due to restaurant readiness—not me.
3️⃣ GPS tracking logs often placed me incorrectly, showing I wasn’t at delivery locations when I was physically there.
4️⃣ I maintained a perfect 5.0 rating from customers.

I was using Earn by Time in the days leading up to my deactivation, and many Dashers believe DoorDash is exploiting this program to accuse drivers of “milking the clock” and deactivate them unfairly.

DoorDash, I’m calling on you to:
1️⃣ Reopen my case and conduct a transparent review with clear evidence.
2️⃣ Address issues with Earn by Time and faulty GPS tracking that are leading to unjust deactivations.
3️⃣ Improve the deactivation process to allow drivers to correct issues before being deactivated.

If my account is not reactivated, I will pursue arbitration.

To the public and fellow Dashers: If you’ve experienced similar issues, I encourage you to speak out. Let’s bring attention to these unfair practices and demand accountability from DoorDash.

1732268952.0,Miles and time driving to you for a 2 dollar tip? Please STOP ,"PLEASE someone tell me why people think it's ok to tip us DD 2 dollars and expect us to drive 8 miles (25 minutes) just to turn around to go back to the area we are scheduled to dash in. 

For an example .... I get a order and don't approve it by scores go down. But when I do approve the dash I drive 2 to 4 miles to the restaurant, wait times can be 1 to 25 minutes, then I have to drive 25 minutes to your home just to turn around and drive 25 minutes back. Since DD gives us TWO dollars per trip that equals to 4 whole dollars for over an hour of my time and gas. 

If you can't tip, please order yourself and take an hour out of your day so we don't have to work for free. 

Also, TURN ON YOUR LIGHTS AT NIGHT. if I have to drive around for an extra two or three minutes just to find your house with no numbers on it don't get mad if it accidentally goes to the wrong house. 

Tip your driver's at least min wage for the time they drive to your home and the time it takes to get back to their original location. Doesn't matter if I'm picking up a catering order or one soda. I'm still doing the same efforts with my time and gas. 

If you live 30 minutes from the restaurant you choose... Tip your driver 15 dollars. That way we can make 17 dollars for that hour it took to bring YOU your food.

What sucks about that, 8 miles out of my zone, is a $2.00 pay cut in minimum wage due to it being a rural area.

Hello! I just started Doordashing and I just wanted to see if this was common or anything. 

The other night, I doordashed for 2 hours on my local University Campus, one of the orders being a double dash for a Sonic and Taco Bell. Out of those 3 orders I received, NONE OF THEM, had a customer tip. Kinda bummed and getting late, I go home to get ready for my retail job.

This morning, I'm still dashing as of typing this, but I've done 2 dashes so far and both of them had no customer tips. This is starting to confuse me. Is everyone on this city tipping $0? or is there something I'm just misunderstanding here. Mainly because I had some bills screw me over, and I love dashing, but im getting low on gas funds here.

1732190720.0,Support told me that my ratings wouldn't be affected... then gave me a Contract Violation,"So the story goes: I was out dashing today on Earn By Time (which usually does well for me) when I picked up a McDonald's order. When I was only about 3 quarters of a mile from the customer, I hit extreme traffic. I initially thought there had been an accident but it turns out when I slowly had gotten closer, a lady in a high vis vest told me there was some sort of food pantry event going on that was blocking up the main road making traffic coming from the direction I was coming from basically unable to move. Let it be known that this was the direction that the in-app Navigation was telling me to go. Also this area is a semi-rural area so basically if I did turn around to find another way it would have taken another 20 minutes to get around to the customer from another direction so I would have been late either way. 

I contacted support while I was waiting and told them that traffic was at a stand-still, but that my ratings would not be affected for this order. So finally after about 50 minutes of slowly inching forward I got through and delivered the order which was only a shake and a pie.

I thought I was gonna be good after what support told me but I still got a CV and submitted a dispute. Extremely ridiculous that something completely out of my control can get me a CV but here we are. Got a fat 20 dollars though from EBT though from sitting for so long though so I guess I'll take that.

I'm still relatively new to dashing (only 1 month, ~200 orders) so if I should have done something different let me know.

1732176209.0,I wasn’t hired and I don’t know why. Can I get them to change their decision?,"About 1.5 months ago I was driving home from a concert going about 38 over the speed limit and got a ticket. First and only moving violation at all. I have the opportunity to either pay the ticket or show up in court to dispute it, but the court is 4 hours away so I pay the ticket and move on. 

Cut to now, I try to apply for DoorDash and they say they are pending my application. I was super scared that they’d say no, especially since I wanted a job that was easy, that paid decent and I could choose when I work and DoorDash was just what I was looking for. However, many others on Reddit and other sites said they had speeding tickets before and were still hired, especially if it was only a single one. Some of them even had DUIs at one point and still got hired. After that I had hope. Then I got an email saying I was not hired and my account would remain deactivated, and I’m really upset because that was the best looking part time job opportunity I had going for me.

3 questions: 

1. Why wasn’t I hired when so many others were despite the same thing?

2. Will taking courses to remove the points from my license or waiting 2 years for the ticket to move off my record change their minds?

1732075593.0,Did this Dasher have a strategy?,"I just had an order take over an hour to get to me. It seemed like the Dasher waited at the restaurant a long time, and the delivery time kept being pushed back. Eventually the driver left the restaurant and made it to my apartment. It seemed like they parked but never moved from the car, unless they left their phone in the car. They then drive away without marking it as delivered or communicating with me at all. I wait a few minutes to see if they forgot, and I run downstairs to see if my meal was delivered. I don’t see it anywhere, and I even walk down the block to see if it was accidentally delivered to the wrong building. I don’t find it, so I contact the driver who is now quite far away and driving in what seems really strange ways. They don’t respond for several minutes, and since they won’t mark it as delivered, I can’t claim it as not delivered. I contact support, they try calling the dasher who doesn’t answer, and they cancel the order, give me a refund, and extra credits which is awesome. But I am starving and now the restaurant is closed and anywhere else that appeals to me is also closed.

I am happy with the result from DoorDash, but I am just wondering why the driver would behave this way? Why not mark the order as delivered and why not respond to me? Maybe they delivered it to the wrong building and I could have a conversation with them to figure out where exactly so I can run and grab it. Perhaps I am being too pessimistic but not marking it as delivered and not responding to me nor the agent seems really suspicious. Is there something dashers could get in trouble for that they try to avoid by not marking it delivered? Because my ability to get a refund was made more annoying by having to contact an agent and wait for them to do their part whereas being able to use the help feature with a built in “I did not receive my order” process that is quicker.

1732074041.0,Need help figuring what to tip,"So after reading a few posts on here, I think maybe I am calculating my tip incorrectly when I order on DD. I usually tip between 20-25% of the cost of the order before taxes and fees, with a minimum of $4.50. I don’t usually order from restaurants more than 5 miles away, but do occasionally order from as far away as 10 miles.  So for a $30 order from 5 miles away, I would tip $6.00-7.00. I also factor in the time of day because if I order during a busier time, I assume there will be more competition for drivers, so I might increase my tip slightly in order to entice a driver to accept it. 

But some commenters are saying I should calculate the tip based on the mileage the driver has to drive. I live in a populated area with restaurants all around, so I don’t think a driver would have to drop my order and then drive 5 miles back to get another order. So for a $30 food order from 5 miles away, what do drivers recommend for the tip amount?

1732073501.0,I had my order stolen by the dasher for the first time in years ,"I’m so mad right now. I have used DoorDash for 4+ years and have spent thousands on dollars (not proud of it). Tonight was the first time I ever had my food stolen. I received the delivery confirmation alert and saw the photo that proved my food was at the door. I went downstairs, turned off the porch light, put some dishes away and refilled my water bottle. This only took a few minutes. By the to me I’m ready to head back upstairs I see that the dashers headlights are still shining on the house. I thought “hmm that’s weird why would they still be here”. Opened the door and the food was no longer at the door. 

I’ve never had this happen before so I was confused. I looked around outside to see if it got blown away (🙄) or something and sure enough nothing. Their car was driving away when I opened the door. 

I’ve had issues before with orders but usually they have been parts were forgotten by the restaurant or the wrong food delivered and customer support has always given be a refund for the items that weren’t delivered, ect. Now this doesn’t happen often. It’s been almost 5 years so I feel like having mistakes happen every so often isn’t a big deal? 

However when I submitted my request for a refund it was immediately declined since the Dasher had proof of delivery of the food at the door. And no I don’t live in a building or neighborhood where people could just walk by and pick up the food. I messaged the dasher to ask her if she stole my food, she never responded. I was able to submit another request in which I was able to provide a summary of what happened. It was declined a few minutes later. I decided to call the customer service number because this was a bunch of crap. The guy didn’t speak great English so that made it hard to understand him but I explained the situation and he just said since it was reviewed twice and rejected nothing could be done. 

I just wanted my refund for that order so I could reorder the food. Even though I was upset about it being stolen, I was fine with just reordering without a second charge. I don’t have a car so I can’t just pick it up. DoorDash has always done right by me so I’m shocked. Maybe it’s stupid to be so upset but I am.",doordash,9,4,0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gvgb9f/i_had_my_order_stolen_by_the_dasher_for_the_first/,True,,ilbailmm,1732073501.0,,,False

1732072058.0,"I don't understand the purpose of ""hotspot zones""","I personally avoid them, but this is what happens every single damn time.

I'll sit in the ""fast food district"" of town where it's not a hotspot zone, and I'll be getting good back to back orders paying good. Then suddenly it lights up and becomes a hotspot zone and then nothing, I'll sit there for 30+ minutes and not get a single offer, or when I do suddenly they're $2/$3 no-tip offers.

This evening, prior to becoming a hotspot zone, I was getting $6+ offers not going far, like back to back. I would drop one off, and soon as I complete it I would get another one. Then the second the area became a hotspot zone after getting all those great back to back orders, I sit there for 45 minutes or so with zero offers coming in and then started getting nothing but $2 and $3 offers. Like, WTF.

This happens every time too, it's not just an isolated thing. It's like every time the area I'm doing GREAT in lights up and becomes a hotspot zone, the offers stop coming in and sit there for more than half an hour, only to then start getting no-tip shit offers.

This is why I f'king hate hotspot zones and never chase after them. They're stupid, and it's when you start getting the worst imaginable offers ever.

I have in the past given no tip and never had an issue. From what I understand my local area has many more dashers than people ordering food. Is the only thing about giving no tip that the order may be ignored or it may take a long time? 

I would love to tip if I was in better circumstances, but I need things, I am ill, and have no family or friends to help.

Why do I say this?? 

I work at a restaurant bakery. We sell a lot of bakery items made in house, so sometimes..we don't have them. So sometimes dashers have to try and contact the person who ordered(to see if they want a refund on that item or to replace it) and they just..don't respond. And it's usually something small like a muffin, or a slice of pie. (But there's been a couple times we didn't have peoples whole orders, because it was busy and we sold all of our bakery, or the manager/baker didn't bother to make any that night) And the dashers are sitting up there waiting, confusing guests, and just wasting both of our times. This isn't to shame anyone, or make anyone feel bad! I've been perpetrator of this crime too, and I understand why someone would do it. You just sorta forget about it when doing something else.

And also please always try have it decided whether or not you want to substitute or not if a place doesn't have an item, I've been on the phone with people for a while as well because they don't know what they want.

I let doordash know that it was a packaging issue as I don't think it was necessarily the driver's fault. They gave me roughly a $10 refund (I paid $25 including his tip). 

Its hard to believe he didn't notice because the bag was extremely soggy and tearing on the side you would have to put your hand under to carry the bag. I don't believe he deserves five stars because  even though it might not be his fault the ranch exploded, it was negligence on his end to not address it before delivery.

That being said, if I order something small, I’m not tipping more than 20-25%. Even if that is like 4 or 5 dollars.

I have like a 2-liter of soda and a 24-pack of canned soda in my fridge. And it's always the low-tipping people that of course has to have drinks included. When ordering, I wish people would take into consideration there's only so much that we can carry. And believe it or not, some places don't have drink carriers for some reason.

Accepted an offer this evening, didn't really pay attention to the details of the order, I knew a drink was included but didn't see how many. Went to go pick up the order and it was 2 bags of food and 4 drinks, and the restaurant had no drink carriers. Like, WTF am I supposed to do? Balance some of the drinks on my head? I only have 2 hands, and they have 2 big bags of food and 4 drinks with no drink carriers they expect me to carry. Not to mention I only have 2 cup holders in my car so what am I to do while driving? Hold the other two in my hands and use my knees to drive?

Once I saw that I told the store employee that without a drink carrier, I have absolutely no way to carry all of that and that my car doesn't even have enough cup holders for that many drinks and just unassigned myself from it and left.

People need to keep in mind that we can only carry and hold so much when they place an order.

1731972787.0,Confused with refunding and credit.,"November 16th, Saturday, I had ordered a door-dash order of $23.33. I waited an hour and there was no one to pick it up, door-dash even sent a notification that said there are no dashers and i could pick up my order instead. I couldn’t pick up my order (hence why i door-dashed) so I wanted to cancel and get a refund. When I went to cancel my order it said i would only get refunded $8 (and some change) and that didnt work for me, so i called customer service and they cancelled it for me. I asked very explicitly if i would get a full refund to my card (a refund of 23.33) and the man on the line said i would, he repeated the amount i would get refunded and said it would go to my card. 

Fast forward to earlier today, I see i have door-dash credits of $8 (and some change), and i was confused because no one mentioned anything about credits. I wanted to make sure my full refund would go to my card like I was told, and I wanted to see if this credit was just complimentary, so I called again and turns out this credit is part of my refund, and only $15 dollars would be going to my card. So i told customer support that I was told i would get a full refund to my CARD, and i made sure I said my card. The lady told me she was able to transfer my full refund to my card, so I felt pretty good. 

Now fast-fast forward to now, I just checked door-dash and see that my credit raised from $8 to $15. Can someone explain?? Will I still get my full refund?

If you hit someone's else's vehicle or God forbid you run down a pedestrian - not only will you not be doing delivery anymore (wrecked your car and removed from the delivery platform), but your life will now be filled with Court Appearances, fines, police investigations, and more. It is not worth it. No job pays you enough to take the risk of colliding into a pedestrian. And when the police arrive, they will ask you how the accident happened and why you were on the WRONG WAY side. Stating ""I didn't have a code"" is not an excuse to break the law.

Complain to your app that you cannot make a delivery without a code. Ask the app to make a section for customers specifically about gate codes when they order. Suggest to your app that they add ""Is there a gate code required to enter?"" that customers must answer when ordering.

1731957991.0,The real explanation behind why non tippers get #%^* service,"I see so many posts complaining about the poor service they got from their DoorDasher, and I *think* I can explain it a little more in depth. 

A platinum level dasher has FIRST priority over high paying deliveries, so the people who are tipping adequately are going to get picked up by a platinum dasher. This means the dasher has paid their dues grinding out 100+ garbage orders already, they’ve learned how to be friendly and time efficient, they probably have a stockpile of straws and sauces from various restaurants in their car in case you ask for more sauce after they already left the restaurant, they either use the cheap free insulated bags that DD provided them- or they have been doing it long enough and actually spent their OWN money on nicer insulated bags, they may even put the seat warmer on in their car to ensure your food stays as hot as humanly possible on the ride to you. Why? Because a platinum dasher wants to keep their platinum level. We get less bs low paying orders, we need to keep above a 4.7 rating and 95% completion rate. These dashers aren’t going to risk their benefits to screw you over out of pettiness. 

The new dashers are the ones given these no to low paying deliveries, cuz it’ll be given to them first & if they accept it and it goes back into circulation- a platinum dasher absolutely will not accept your order, and it will be pushed back down to another new dasher, or even force the original one that declined it to accept it(happened to me when I was still new, I’d decline an order and it’d come back around 3 mins later and literally make me accept it against my will)
These dashers don’t have rapport with DD yet, they haven’t done that many dashes yet, they’re still figuring out the system and the do’s and don’ts of dashing, and deciding if they even like doing it or not. This is why if you don’t tip, a new dasher, or a dasher who doesn’t qualify for platinum status because of bad reviews or too low of a completion rate(means they prob have stolen some orders or quit in the middle of a dash) will be the one assigned your order, and your chances of getting a less than favorable delivery are wayyy higher than if you tipped and got it picked up by a platinum dasher who is thirsty for 5* reviews and providing quality service.

1731945257.0,Doordash Adjustment ,"Wondering how I can get a higher adjustment. A lot of drivers say take your time. I thought it was the opposite because a few weeks ago my active time was 16 hours, dash time was 62 hours, and adjustment was $287 

The next few weeks, the dash time is always higher still, but not by 50 hours like this one. Maybe by 10 hours, and I haven't got an adjustment because I make more than the minimum 

So I'm assuming the dash time needs to be significantly higher than active time right? 

And active time is the actual time you're completing an order

I started out with Uber Eats first, and that was a complete joke. My girlfriend told me she used to have luck with DoorDash so I gave that a shot recently. 

At first, I was taking every delivery that was coming my way because I didn’t want to affect my acceptance rating and I wanted the platinum status. While I do like being able to start dashing at any time, it feels really good to turn down those ridiculous deliveries that don’t pay enough to even cover expenses.

 I recently hit around 200 deliveries. And have been reading everything you guys have been posting about it not being worth taking everything that comes your way. And you are 100% correct. I’ve been traveling less miles and making more money. I just wanna say Thank You to you guys for your posts and showing me the way.

1731896172.0,Stacked Orders,"I am so sick of Door Dash stacking orders. I assume that's what the term is for what happens to my orders. I order something, it gets picked up immediately, and then the driver goes in a completely different direction, waits for a second order, makes a dropoff, then gets to me like 20 minutes later.

From what I've read, DoorDash does this to stack up orders of non-tippers with tippers, to give an incentive to grab both. I tip pretty well and my food almost always gets picked up very quickly. If a driver is \*really\* fast, I sometimes add a few extra bucks. Easy orders -- a house with no complicated instructions, etc. 

The drivers say that the tip is less option and more of a 'bid' for them to take the work. And I'm actually fine with that. It makes sense. The problem I have is, the tip is not always commensurate with service. Why should I tip more if DoorDash just sends a driver on a second order before mine?

I have had great drivers deliver my food quickly. Tonight, this guy has had my food in the back of his car for 20 minutes. Probably not even his fault. It's ridiculous. Assuming I'm interpreting it correctly, DoorDash needs to stop with this stacked order garbage.

1731894293.0,Why are drivers so bad at finding addresses?,"I was lazy today and ordered DoorDash twice, once for breakfast and another for dinner. This morning my dasher (who has delivered to me 4+ times before) parked across the street from me. I figured she would see me and just walk over but alas she did not. Instead she calls me and proceeds to repeat over and over again that she does not speak English only Spanish. So I then proceeded to wave my arms around like the wacky wavy inflatable arm guy for several minutes until she looked over and saw me. Then she sends her what looked to be 10 year old kid over to bring me my food never actually getting out of the car herself. 

Then for dinner I tried ordering again and again got another dasher who has delivered to me multiple times. He proceeds to park across the street from my building as well about a half block up from where I'm at. Then he calls me to tell me he's there and I explain I'm actually across the street several houses back. I'm also again already waiting out on my front stoop in anticipation of my delivery so I wave at him thinking surely he sees me. He says he does, great he'll be there in a second. Wrong. Apparently he saw people sitting on another stoop in the complete opposite direction and starts heading there while I'm trying to shout at him from across the busy main street. He did not hear me so I had to call him back and explain that he went the wrong way until finally he realizes his mistake and heads over. He even comments as he's walking up to me oh I should have remembered I've delivered to you a bunch in the past. 

So I just wanna throw this out there for any DoorDash drivers reading this. In America many cities will number housing on certain sides of the street with all odd numbers or all even numbers.

So I work at a company that offers doordash delivery — we’re quite new to delivery apps especially doordash in particular but we ran into an issue and i’m not entirely sure if its something on our end or what. We recently got an order today and our store closes at 8PM EST. we have our orders set to automatically stop taking after 7:30, since we get out pretty quickly by the time 8:00 hits. This is the second time we’ve encountered this issue but someone placed a scheduled order, which we weren’t even aware it was scheduled until we checked the website (we dont have one of those tablets, at least not yet. im not sure if we have plans of getting one or not yet.)  The order that was scheduled still hasn’t been picked up yet and we dont know if this is a glitch or something on the website or doordash or if this is user error on our part. we cant really refund them (im sure most of you are aware of that though), and we get no details regarding the customer so we cant inform them either. I was just curious if this is a common occurrence or something, we’re new so I’m just trying to get answers for everyone. if any other details is needed i can provide, i just wanted to ask, i figured it wouldn’t hurt much.",doordash,1,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gtsoy1/scheduled_orders_merchant_question/,True,,ileyvia,1731891518.0,,,False

1731860076.0,Detailed Delivery Instructions and still delivered to wrong house,"Hey Door dash community,

I placed an order last night and it got sent to my neighbors (who I'm not cordial with and wouldn't trust with my food at all). It isn't the first time this has happened but the first time the dasher told me the location ping was at their address. I checked and it didn't appear to be but I edited it to be sure. 

Ive also seen people suggesting you should include in the delivery notes detailed instructions in case the ping is wrong. Since then I've always left very specific instructions to avoid confusion (ex: please leave on the green chair, we have a no soliciting sign in the window).

Yesterday I ordered and the picture showed the driver left it at my neighbors on the floor outside their door. Someone brought my food back and rang the bell (also in my delivery instructions not to do since we have a loud dog). I'm suspecting it was someone staying at my neighbors (I think they're away) and fortunately the food was still sealed so I don't believe it was tampered with. I'm just frustrated because I'm not sure why I'm tipping a driver beforehand for them to still not follow clearcut instructions.

 I know doordash is cut throat and people don't make a lot of money. I feel bad filing a complaint and maybe getting the delivery driver in trouble. I have no proof they corrected their mistake because the picture shows it at the wrong address - and that is also their proof they correctly delivered, which obviously they didn't. DD hasn't prompted me to rate the delivery which I find odd but I'm not well versed in doordash and it's workings. 

I'm just conflicted because I don't think I should be paying for a wrong delivery when I've done everything to make it clear where I'm located. Just wondering what delivery drivers think about this as you have insight into the other side. Could it be this is just a doordash bug or was the driver just neglectful? I just don't want to be unfair to the delivery driver if this wasn't explicitly their fault.

1731843214.0,Completely Ripped Off?,"I am beside myself... I ordered alcohol from a liquorland nearby. The app told me I had to scan my I.D to add 18+ products, so I did and it accepted it.

When the dasher arrived, he was trying to scan my I.D and it wouldn't allow him after many tries. He said he couldn't leave the order and had to return it. The store had closed by that time, so I checked and the order was completed and he blocked me from communicating with him. He's obviously taken it.

I spoke to Doordash support who said they can't process a refund at all because it's an alcohol order. Then wtf happens to my money?? 

I've spoken to five different agents and all they can tell me is that I can't get my money back and that's it.

1731840783.0,DoorDash Deactivated me. ,"**UPDATE:** I should have clarified this earlier—my stats plummeted after I moved to a city I won't name in North Florida from Orlando. In Orlando, I had a 95% acceptance rate, 100% completion rate, 99% on-time rate, and a perfect 5.0 customer rating. I was thriving there. But since moving, my experience has been terrible, and so are my stats.

The traffic here is a nightmare. Every day, I either witness an accident or a close call. This city consistently ranks in the top 15 for worst drivers in the US—with a little research, you'll figure out which city I'm in. Food is almost always late, making multi-apping a risky move. Drivers are either painfully slow or dangerously aggressive. In one week alone, I've nearly been hit three times by people blowing through stop signs. GPS here is useless; I'm constantly having to call customers for directions. It’s one thing for GPS to be off occasionally, but here it regularly drops me in the middle of nowhere.

I've been dinged with low ratings for things beyond my control. A leaky cup holder (I ended up buying my own off Amazon), a duplex with the same unit number and street name as the one two blocks over. Why would you have two identical addresses within a 3-block radius? 

Once I arrived at an address with three identical food orders already sitting outside, making mine #4. After leaving, I get a call from the customer saying she never got the order. After a bit of research, I realize that all the food I saw was from her constantly having to reorder her food because her address doesn't show up correct in the GPS because there's a house with the exact address as her duplex a block away! 

And don't even get me started on trying to deliver to trailer parks in the middle of the night when you can't even see the address/unit on the trailer. It's been a nightmare.

So yeah, judge me all you want. I'll take it. But this low-stat performance is a recent phenomenon. A month ago, I drove back to Orlando and my stats improved in just those two days, so I'm not just imagining things.

Anyway, I'll take the L. DD has been a real pain here, and honestly, I'm over it now. My instacart stats are fantastic, and I'll just have to drive back to orlando to work and get my UberEats stats back up. I'm planning on moving out of this crappy city as soon as I get my finances back in order. 

**ORIGINAL POST:** I worked for DoorDash for over a year, consistently going above and beyond for customers. At the time of my deactivation, my acceptance rate was around 45%, customer rating 4.7, and completion rate was 93% with 2 contract violations—one which was removed after a dispute.

DoorDash has been a stressful gig. Most zones near me don't pay well. The only zone that does requires scheduling a week in advance, which needs to be done between 12am and 4am, as they fill up fast due to market oversaturation.

The app is glitchy. It often freezes, kicking me out of my scheduled shift. If I pause for a few minutes, it sometimes ends my shift early, and driving out of my zone for 10+ minutes can do the same.

I was deactivated for late deliveries. I’ve stayed late at restaurants to ensure customers get their orders, even when previous drivers failed to deliver. DoorDash staff told me this was okay, but it seems to have impacted my Completed on Time rating, which was around 75%. If there was a threshold for this metric, I would have appreciated knowing, so I could have avoided waiting and declined those orders.

I requested an appeal, but it was denied without explanation. I’m frustrated because I had shifts lined up this weekend that I now can’t work.

I used to dismiss complaints about DoorDash on Reddit, thinking people weren't being honest about their performance. Now, I get it. DoorDash demanded more from me than I ever did from them. I worked hard because they paid better than UberEats locally, despite fewer orders. Now, I’m forced back to UberEats, where the rates are terrible—like $3 for 15 miles.

I chose gig work to escape the usual workplace issues. The appeal was the control over hours and earnings, even if the pay wasn't great. Now, right before the holidays when I need money most, I can’t work. DoorDash turned out worse than any brick-and-mortar job—there’s no HR or warning, just a sudden deactivation that leaves you unemployed.

My advice: take the complaints on Reddit seriously and protect your job. Ultimately, the best job is one you control. I’m making changes to ensure I’m never this dependent on a company like DoorDash again.

1731795528.0,I'm so confused about tipping...,"It used to be possible to tip upon placing the order, or upon delivery. Then it was changed to ""you can't tip before delivery"". So I'd just have to tip in the app right after seeing the delivery person or pay in the app after grabbing my food if I opted for contactless non-interaction.

Last year I had an issue where I couldn't tip at all even after delivery, so I did a live-chat and the support person applied the tip for me. They asked, and I sad ""please apply a $5 tip to this order for the dasher"" (in not so many words).

Okay, so you can't tip while waiting for the order or before pick-up and delivery. Fine, it's not really logical to tip until after I receive my food. Last night I place a double-dash order so in this case I definitely want to tip properly. As the man was approaching my door, I try to give a tip in the app and it doesn't work. I get some error message. 

So luckily, just in the nick of time I give the man a $5 bill.... that's something, but it's not enough for shuffling to 7-11 while also delivering my Chinese food. So I try again in the app, I try to tip both orders... both give an error. The next step, reach out to support.

I start a live-chat with a chat-bot which eventually gets me a human keyboard operator. Must be a keyboard operator because all they did was read me the policy about how you can't tip before the dasher pics-up or delivers the food. It's as if they didn't really read my issue. So, I reiterate... and hten the person tells me **""it's too late to tip because you can't tip after the order is completed""**.



I'm so confused. **Can't tip before but can't tip after, either?** I'm sure I'm just missing something obvious, but this is feeling a bit unnecessary complicated for me as someone who just wants to no screw over any person who delivers food to my door. Can anyone please help me understand this before I reach out to support for a third time (which precedes a formal complaint, which sux bc that doesn't get a fair tip to the dasher).",doordash,3,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gsyk1m/im_so_confused_about_tipping/,True,,djronnieg,1731795528.0,,,False

1731790381.0,How to consider appropriate/fair tip for Delivery App Drivers.,"This is a guide that just helps people consider a fair tip for their order so you are likely to get quick and efficient delivery.

1. The most important aspect of calculating a tip for Doordash, should mostly be based on distance and time the driver will have to go. So if you are ordering from a Restaurant 5 miles away and it normally takes 10-15 minutes to drive there, the tip should reflect that. Consider the driver needs to wait on the order. A minimum tip in this scenario should be $5(all of this is based on assumption that the delivery is done correctly and all instructions are followed aka a good job).

2. Order size should only be factored into your tip if the order is heavy or larger than normal. A 15+ item shopping order is absolutely something you should be factoring into your tip. Time is $.. ordering 1 tiny thing from CVS should not change anything when it comes to tipping based on time and distance. 

3. Time of day and traffic need to be factored into your tip. If you live in a densely populated area, that is prone to traffic and has parking difficulties, and your order during Rush Hour, please consider the extra time and effort the driver will need to exert for a delivery like this.


These 3 things are the main considerations to take into account if you care about tipping fairly and appropriately. This is not a thread to argue about tipping or exact amounts. It is just a basic guide to help regular people understand how Doordash drivers can be fairly tipped and what to consider when tipping. That is all. I feel like many people do not understand how to tip app drivers, and many customers have asked me about this, so I thought a simple guide could be helpful.

1731739860.0,"Okay, I think I need technical help","I commented on someone else's post earlier today, which ended up becoming a big long back & forth with several other people. In a nutshell, it's sounds like either my app is glitched, or else I am simply not understanding the rating system. So here goes ...

My total number of customer ratings suddenly dive bombed this week. I have approx. 750 lifetime deliveries, and as of last week I had 99 customer ratings. (I don't recall the exact breakdown, but it was like 98 were 5-star and 1 was 4-star. Something like that.) Meaning, my average overall rating was like 4.98 or something. Suddenly, at the start of this current week, my total number of customer ratings is only 10, and my average has gone up to 5.0

After speaking with a few other dashers here on this subreddit, I got the impression that my app might be glitched. So I chatted with 3 different support agents tonight after my dashing was done, but they all told me the exact same thing: 1) If I think my app is glitched, do this list of troubleshooting steps. [Your basic clear cache, uninstall and reinstall the app, etc.] Well I did the entire list of things like 3x and it didn't help. Which brings us to 2) All 3 of the agents I spoke with told me that customer ratings ""roll over"" after each 100 deliveries. I talked around and around and around with all of them, explaining that I wasn't talking about the AVERAGE, what I was talking about is the BREAKDOWN, or the individual total ratings. But they would just repeat the same thing, that it refreshes after every 100 deliveries and the ratings restart at zero.

By the time I was done with the 3rd support agent, I was thoroughly confused. So that's why I'm turning to my fellow dashers... can you please help me understand?

(The screenshots are of just one conversation I had with support, but all my conversations basically went the same way. I'm pretty sure they were talking about AVERAGE rating, and they were not understanding that I was asking about the BREAKDOWN.)

1731729463.0,A couple of newbie tips,"Hey yall,

background: dd for 1 year on/off; 400+ deliveries

southeast usa, big city

* your acceptance rate matters; they look at it to see how well you are dependable. They may not say it, but they are watching and will give you better deals and orders ""invisible hand"" 
* As a 1099, part time, just do the taxes on turbo tax and take standard deduction. I dont track all that bullshit.
* Use the doordash debit card and keep all expenses on that, for work, lunches/dinners on shift, etc. Even groceries. 
* Work peak hours AMAP, its worth it then. I made like 65-70 in 3 hours last saturday 07:30pm-10pm
* Try to do it part time, 05:30-08:30 is great.
* working class people TIP GOOD they are your street friends. dont expect rich folks to tip.
* Keep a kind demeanour about you even if you are cranky or tired, be non-judgemental and offer resolutions to customers that are speedy and in their favor. 
* More importantly, stay consistent don't just have a shitty night and quit. Keep at it
* Maintain your acceptance rate above 70, don't decline unless you have an emergency, and even take the shit long distance order that's 15 miles for 8 bucks time to time. I find the algo takes me to busier zones and I just switch zones wherever I land. DD is trying to force you to work the zones they need people IN, not what you want (thats why they ask you to travel far time to time) when you get there, just switch and do that area for a little bit, by end of shift it shuld bring you closer to home anyways",doordash,5,3,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gsexiq/a_couple_of_newbie_tips/,True,,Fair_Description1604,1731729463.0,,,False

Usually back to back orders, great offers with good tips. I figured with the big boxing match this evening that even more people would be ordering so they could stay home and watch the match. Far from the case.

Typically any night of the week I make $70-$150, started dashing at 3PM and stopped about 8:30 and I never even made it to $30 that entire time. Offers were far and few between, a crap ton of no-tip offers. Got a crap ton of lowball offers for like $6 wanting me to deliver 8+ miles away. My AR tanked big time this evening. I typically keep it 85%-90% to maintain platinum status so I can decline crap offers. Ended the night with my AR at 73%. 

I got so many $2 no-tip and $3 offers it was f'king ridiculous. I've never declined so many offers in one night, most evenings the offers are great and don't have to decline any. I don't get what the deal was this evening. I generally don't touch $4 offers, but that's all doordash was throwing me and I wanted to make some $$$ so I just started accepting them as long as they were going less than a mile. Sadly, 5 hours dashing the best offer I got this evening paid $5.50. This was NOT a normal evening of dashing for me.

1731712192.0,Double charged ,"TLDR- Doordash had double charged me $300 and denied ever doing so. 

I posted this last week to this sub but I was stressed out about this whole situation to make any ounce of sense.

On Halloween, I had ordered about $300 worth of groceries. I did this because I have a significant back injury and no car. While the driver was shopping, something wasn't available so the price changed/went down. I was like sweet, thanks for the heads up and the dasher had changed it from the app and at the end of the whole order, the amount was corrected to the right amount it was supposed to. 
The next day, I looked at my bank account and saw the adjustment price was already posted on my account. The Saturday morning afterwards, I looked at my bank account and saw that there was a pending charge on my account for another $300. So I called Doordash to see why I was charged again, and when I called, they explained that it was the adjusted price, i told them it wasn't, that it was already posted and that this was a completely different charge. 
When I sent them a screenshot of my bank statement and then I was then told ""No, we didn't charge you that"" even though the new pending charge was the exact same amount and says the exact same thing. When I pointed it out to them and that if they could do anything about it, I was screamed at to ""Fuck you and your payment, it's not our job to figure that fucking shit out."" I had that said to me twice by two separate people trying to figure out why I was charged.

normally i try to keep it small and order fast food combos and tip $2 because i can’t really afford anything else but this sub has illuminated to me how little my dashers have been making on my cheap taco bell and pizza orders, and i now have a lot of guilt about my inability to be a good tipper as an unemployed student.

my questions are: does dashpass mitigate the lack of tip in any way? would you accept for ex. a biggie bag order with $2 tip if the wendy’s is 1.2 miles away? lastly should i order DD less frequently as to not burden dashers with my bad orders?

1731691877.0,Restaurants beware!,"I work for a small chain sports bar and we have been getting hit with a specific scam. The full order comes in to the kitchen no problem, but on the tablet, it only shows the customer ordered a side of sauce. It is SIMILAR to the other side of sauce scam they’ve been doing but it’s different in this sense-

The kitchen received a full order of food with a specific customers name from DoorDash. Multiple entrees. Kitchen starts to prepare as normal. 

As orders are set to automatically send to the kitchen because we get a pretty good to-go business throughout the day, upon reviewing the order, it’s just a side of cheese sauce  which is $1. 

Here’s my hypothesis:
The customer makes their order as normal, and has a pre-loaded script to run, that deletes the full cart, adds a side of cheese sauce to the cart, while the 1-2 second payment processing window is happening. So the “send to kitchen” function is happening before payment is confirmed somehow.

Sorry, just a rant. It's super frustrating, especially when we're sick and can barely even get to the door, let alone have the energy to put shoes on and go to the other door to get it.
Edit: I realize I may sound like a Karen. I just don't understand. Our pin is at our door, not the other one.

$10 order,
$5 tip,
4.7 miles from restaurant to a hospital.
I was messaged twice before pickup, with the driver straight up asking me to add to the tip. 
The hospital is a big maze, so I gave instructions to come right up to the front. I watched on the map and went to the glass doors to watch when I saw they were close. I watched them park, and pulled the app back up to make sure it was them before walking up. As soon as the app opens I have a third message, ""I cannot wait for you, I'm leaving it by the road"". 
Not even 30 seconds parked before that message. 
So I waved at him while coming out the door as he was getting out of the car, and he still put it on the ground instead of handing it to me. I gave him three stars and marked ""rude"".

1731608757.0,Door Dash is so bad… it might be good. ,"Advice on how to make sure as a customer, your orders are correct?

I door dash daily because I was signed up for the annual dash pass without my permission, and when I tried to cancel it within 10 minutes of noticing the subscription charge, they refused. So, I decided to use it as much as possible in the year to get my moneys worth. 

I am not joking when I say for every 10 orders I do, maybe 2 or 3 are correct. Only 1 or 2 of 10 ever come as a complete order with utensils and everything. 

It is my go to now to send a message that says “Hi (dasher,) please double check for (drink/side/food/etc) and utensils as (restaurant) usually forgets. Thank you so much!” As a way to cover my bases as the customer. 

They usually always respond with “will do” but my orders still arrive wrong. I always report it for the difference back, and since I’m a frequent user they often throw on an apology credit with the refund. So i realistically get a lot of things for free because door dash hires incompetent people. 

My question is: what else can I possibly do to ensure my orders are right? I feel bad that the company has to refund me every other day, but I’m also not paying for items I didn’t receive… like paying for a large $7 soda and getting an empty cup and no straw.

What else can I do? Or does DD just suck?",doordash,51,0,0.27,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1grbisr/door_dash_is_so_bad_it_might_be_good/,True,,Remote-Republic1841,1731608757.0,,,False

Paid the $6 shipping fee, and I did select the box that said something along the lines of “allow courier delivery if available to receive order sooner.” I live roughly 25 minutes from the nearest Walgreens (rural area), so I figured it wouldn’t happen either way and I would be waiting the 2-4 days for delivery. Well within 5 minutes, my order was picked up by DoorDash?? I tried figuring out how to add a tip, but the link I was sent wouldn’t even allow me to do so. I ordered through the Walgreens website, and it didn’t say anything about a tip. I feel horrible!

While I’m glad I have it sooner, I would have been fine waiting the 2-4 days. So can someone tell me if they receive a higher pay for these orders?

1731603011.0,Spending on service,"I’m a dasher and a doordash customer often, So I understand both sides of wanting tips and not wanting to spend a lot on delivery by giving a low tip. But the thing is, you pay for your food and the service if you want it delivered. Doordash also is a corporation so they’re going to obviously take their cut whether or not you agree it should be lower so they can pay drivers more. I understand the regular definition of a tip as being an extra if you receive especially good service, so on doordash I think using the word tip when in actuality you’re paying to receive the service in the first place instead of giving extra for good service, is a misnomer because it leads some customers to believe that it’s an extra payment for good service when in reality it’s going to be the majority of what a dasher makes and should be based on how badly you need something delivered and how much you think a dasher deserves for completing a service for you. I agree that it should be doordash paying us but the fact is that they aren’t. That isn’t going to change any time soon so while it is unfair, the responsibility of paying the people in your community falls on you, the consumer.

1731514717.0,PSA for Dashers & question for customers.,"I'm both a Dasher and a DD customer. Dear Dashers who Smoke:

Your smoke permeates your orders. It makes them smell and taste foul. Stop being gross and smoking your cancer sticks in the car with your customers' food. They can and will complain and you can and will either be dinged for it or be locked out as a Dasher. Customers have respiratory issues. Customers have allergies. Customers have asthma. And if a customer tells you ""next time, consider your customer and don't smoke with their order in the car"", don't snap back with ""then go and get it yourself, I'm grown, b\*\*\*\*"".

Not everyone engages in your vice and it causes active harm to some people. Stop it.

Sincerely,

A Dasher & DoorDash customer who ISN'T nasty.

1731506216.0,Driving vs Parked Getting Orders,"I have 2 major hotspots in my zone where I return to and park if orders are not coming in. They are about 4.5 miles apart on each side of the city. I know when each is busy and at what time, so I coordinate accordingly. There are other hotspots, but those are unimportant for this story.

I swear that Doordash wants me to drive around burning gas for no reason!!! I can be sitting in one area with no orders coming in and the very second I pull out to leave or shortly after, to go to the other side, they start bombarding me with orders from the side I'm leaving. And vice-versa! Never fails. Yesterday lunch was over, and things slowed down, so I was halfway to the other side. They started sending order after order, like they were trying to get me to come back while I drove to the other side. They didn't stop until I made it! I know dang well, there were more than enough Dashers available on that side that were without orders.

The point is that I can sit and not get any orders, and then shortly after I start driving, bam!!

Seems like Doordash just wants me to burn gas or wait until I'm miles away from the restaurants / area before they want me there! 🤣🤣

And I have a pet peeve anyway. If I am tired of an area and I have decided to move somewhere else and I'm moving away... don't be sending me orders behind me unless they are worth $20 or more... because I'm not doing any u-turns, waiting on stoplights, or pulling into parking lots to turn the heck around.

1731504918.0,Question for everyone unhappy with DoorDash,"So like, I was a Dasher and used to use DD for a number of years when I owned a business in which I could not leave to get food, and it was a nice perk to offer my employees. It’s gone downhill fast in the last year or so, not sure if those of you who used it when it was first out agree that it was better, service wise?

My question is though, why aren’t we, unhappy customers and dashers as a whole kinda doing anything about their absolutely horrible downturn in business practices? Like tanking their ratings on all possible platforms, App Store, BBB, wherever is possible to leave DoorDash a rating? 
I know it feels like nudging their 4.8 star rating on Apple App Store from over a million reviews seems pointless, but like… if enough folks do something, and explain why they’re so unhappy… maybe something will give?

I dunno, I just am so dejected that a service I was once really happy with has gone in the toilet. And every time I read about something awful happening to someone on here and DD customer service not doing anything and not caring… I feel worse. I am upset for everyone who is done wrong. I feel like something must be able to be done…there has to be.

1731481779.0,Disconnect When Ordering From Restaurant And Delivery From Door Dash - Wendy's,"This has happened to me for the second time. I placed an order through the Wendy's app. It asks me for delivery instructions, I write in where to leave the order, and to please not ring the bell. The order is sent to Door Dash for 3rd party delivery, and I get a notification there are missing delivery instructions. What it wants is an apartment number which they don't need as we live in a house. But then I see under further instructions it says ""hand to me."" I edit that and put the same instructions in for where to leave the order.

I have a sick husband freshly home from the hospital and two large dogs (who rightfully scare the crap out of people) who aren't fans of people coming to the door. I just want a simple, hassle free delivery to feed me and the kid.

The driver comes up to the door (I am watching on the camera with the dogs in another room hoping to avoid a fuss) and he bangs on the door. About two seconds later he is ringing the bell, then bangs again, and rings the bell TWO MORE TIMES.

I open the door a crack - the dogs are losing their minds - and say ""please leave the food on the chair, per the instructions."" And close the door. And go back to watching the camera. He looks confused, then a bit pissed, and turns and looks as though he's going to walk away with the food. Then he yells at the car ""get my phone"" before putting the food on the chair, giving up on whoever he was yelling to, and leaves.

Where is the disconnect? I don't know if I should be upset with the dasher for not following instructions or upset with Wendy's for not relaying information, or with Door Dash for not relaying information. But I can say it has happened twice now when ordering through the Wendy's app.

To a lesser degree, I have always wondered why it was such a big deal on their end whether the order is left at the door or handed off. If handed off they don't get any kind of proof. They know they handed it off but they don't take a picture of the customer or get a code or anything that would prove they handed it off. So if something goes south it's kind of a he said/she said situation. But if it's left per the customer's instruction they have to take a photo.",doordash,3,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gq7b29/disconnect_when_ordering_from_restaurant_and/,True,,FrankieMaddox,1731481779.0,,,False

I want to be sure the dasher isn’t ripped off, as far as pay goes. 


My order had 40 items, mostly produce and meat. I made sure to not include any annoyingly heavy items (no packs of water, soda, dog food, etc) because I don’t want to be a burden on anyone. 


He was able to get everything pretty quickly and only needed to refund or substitute a few  items and was communicative and kind. My initial tip when I placed my order was 20% ($17) - is this an okay tip? The store is ~12 miles away, with 75% of it being highway miles.

1731393297.0,Possible Scam: Customer's Perspective,"Wanted to share in case this helps anyone/ wondering if anyone had a similar experience.

I order a bag of dog food through Petco, which uses doordash drivers.

Right as the order was supposed to be delivered, I had two calls come one from a man followed by a woman within minutes of each other asking if my order had been delivered. They both hung up quickly after I told them no, but the map shows it should be soon. The woman claimed that the driver said it had been delivered. I don't recall giving them any personal information, but may have confirmed my phone number? I don't recall.

Shortly after I got a text from petco saying my order was delivered and to call my dasher ""Robert"" if there was any issues. I had not recieved the item, and when I called the number it was an old lady who did not know who Robert was.

I called doordash support, they said that they had not called me. They said they had a different number on file than the one petco's doordash number provided me ( I know this is petco's number as they provided me with the doordash tracking and I've gotten order texts from them before). They did not recieve a picture from the driver. They dispatched a new dasher.

The new dasher called me from Petco saying that Petco gave my dog food to the first dasher an hour prior and that I need to call Petco support to dispatch a new order, so the new dasher could not even pick up my order despite already being there, so they had to cancel my order. I felt bad for the dasher who drove there with no order to pick up, but she was very understanding about it.

Given the discrepency in the phone number for the initial dasher, I'm pretty sure the dasher just stole it. But maybe someone scammed the initial dasher and changed the numbers? Why would ""doordash"" call me to ask if the order was delivered? Curious to hear a dasher's perspective.",doordash,1,2,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gpenck/possible_scam_customers_perspective/,True,,Beneficial-Praline17,1731393297.0,,,False
1731390592.0,FT KNOX DOORDASHING,"Hey everyone. I did doordash awhile back in London, KY. I recently relocated to Elizabethtown, KY. I started doordash again over the weekend and only got 38 orders toward my 100 to get platinum perks from Friday to today (Monday). There must be a ton of dashers in Etown because it hardly let's me dash now during lunch and dinner rushes, and when it does, it's only for 30 minute increments then cuts me off. Even scheduling doesn't have Etown hardly until like 4-5 days later with awful times for example of 2-330 am. I have a full-time job Tuesday-Friday from 7am-5:30pm, so I'm just dashing after work and of course Saturday-Monday when I can.

The reason I started dashing again is because the paychecks from my regular 40 hr job are literally gone every week. It takes every penny I have to afford my bills. I've made a lot of dumb choices with loans and credit cards, and when adding rent, car payment, insurance, utilities, etc I am 100% broke on Fridays. When I say I don't have a penny left from those checks, I mean it. While I'm not too upset about being broke because all my bills are paid which is most important for me, it's really hard to do anything else. I can't even afford a McDouble if I wanted it and occasionally it does get frustrating and mentally exhausting.

That being said, I relocated here to start a life with  my girlfriend who I had a long distance relationship with. She's literally the best thing that has ever happened to me and I know people say this all the time, but this woman truly, TRULY!!, saved my life. She got me away from all the bad stuff I was doing and still loves me solely for me and nothing else. She loved the good and the bad and doesn't judge me in the slightest for my past. She's the biggest blessing aside from my daughter that I've ever received in my life, and I'm extremely grateful to have her and try my best to make sure she knows everyday she's alive how beautiful, amazing, and loved she is by me.

All that sappy stuff aside lol, I am doordashing to save up to buy her an engagement ring. The one I want is $1500. I made $254 last weekend, and I'm trying my hardest to make the money by Christmas. I am willing to work my ass off to achieve that, honestly. I just want to make her happy is all.

I was hoping someone in here is from the Etown area and could tell me what dashing on Ft. Knox is like and if it's worth it. They are always showing as either very busy to busy the entire day. It even let's you schedule the entire day the next day from 7am-9pm instead of 4-5 days later like Etown does. I'm pretty sure they're open to dashing from 7am-9pm everyday, but I may be wrong. I know you have to go to the visitors center to get a 1 year pass, I do know that.

My main question is, do they order a lot from places on base, or is it mostly off base then back on? I really don't want to have to go to Etown and back over and over 100x a day. Radcliff wouldn't be so bad, or on base even better. My brother works for the DoD and has to go in office 2 days a week on base and he said the MPs are really strict about speeding as well so much so that he said they've pulled people over and immediately searched their car. Are they really that strict? I just don't see it being worthwhile to drive to say Dunkin in Etown from base then back for $5.50 and also always looking over my shoulder to get pulled over doing 37 in a 35. If anyone has any experience there, please let me know so if it's worth it, I can be down Saturday to get my pass and hopefully make some good money to get closer to getting this ring.

1731318265.0,DASH HACKS,"I just wanted to offer up a few tips and tricks I've picked up over nearly 1k dashes. I've made some damn good money when I had to. Dash during prime time! Lunch and dinner; there's usually a good 4-4.5hr window for both depending on your market. Try to hang around areas with alot of dining options, from fast food to sometimes fine dining. Try to avoid areas that you know don't, or probably won't tip. Every city has bad areas. Don't be afraid to decline the BS  Try to accept orders that average  $1.50+/mile; that's really the only way to start making decent money but it's honestly not always possible to do that. Now if a $20 15 mile order comes in, I'm prolly taking that, and if it's a slow time of day, I'll take some BS just to pass the time it keep my rates up. If you have to pause your dash for a short bit to get back to a good zone, then do it. Look at the customer instructions and map before you leave. GPS isn't always right and if you know the area, short cuts can save you so much time. Especially during rush hour or in high traffic areas. TIME IS MONEY! Communicate with the customer via text from wait time to eta with the order. I get so many added tips and cash tips just because I communicate, and sometimes BS with the customer. Most importantly, please take your appearance, and your vehicle's if possible, seriously. Nobody wants someone who looks like they smell funny handling their food lol. Be friendly and smile with your entire face; body language speaks volumes. Just remember that ultimately, we're in the customer service business. It feels like I've been rambling, but it's because stuff just kept coming to me and I'm sure there's more. There's definitely money to be made if you really want to make it. I hope this helps.

1731281196.0,Terrible dasher experience ,"Just got my order a few mins ago, and the dasher had over 15,000 deliveries with a 4.8 rating. And the result is a pizza that looked like it wasn't taken care of at all during the delivery process. I don't know how it's possible to have that many deliveries as a dasher and not know pizza needs to be handled horizontally when delivering? I had to rewind security camera footage to see what happened and this dasher on his bike handled the pizza like it was a book. Also, when he took it out his book bag vertically, he proceeded to shake the pizza box as if it that was going to help. SMH. I did get my money back after sending photos to customer service, but this shouldn't really be happening.

Update: I've added camera footage of this great dasher, to back up my claims. I'm saddened that there are people who actually defend this type of service as being acceptable.

1731281057.0,Question for Dashers in New York City— do you see the order ahead of time? ,"So I regularly use DoorDash for large grocery orders. I don’t have a car and I have physical limitations so this has been a great option. I always tip despite the fact that there is apparently an hourly rate and always tip pretty well. Just getting that out of the way. I placed an order from a grocery store that had a fair amount of items, nothing too crazy… I see the Dasher that accepts the order is on a bike apparently. Assuming that the little icon thing that DoorDash shows is accurate. It takes this person quite a long time to reach the grocery store and by the time they do, they call me angrily saying that I ordered too much for DoorDash. The person had very broken English, but I kept telling them to cancel the order and they never did but acted as if the majority of items were out of stock… they were definitely not the kind of items that would be out of stock. My order total was about $100 and they delivered maybe a third of it. I had already tipped and I was pissed off about this. Customer service was essentially useless, but after badgering them a few times they gave me DoorDash credits to make up for the balance. What happened here? Doesn’t the Dasher see what the order is? And if they can accept it? Like I would assume that some people avoid orders from certain stores because it’s too out-of-the-way or they don’t want to go there or whatever. Why would this person do this?

I have never had anyone that even remotely has a hard time finding the building and I tip A LOT. 
I door dash once a week and no issues.
It took her almost 30 minutes to find the building. I finally called her back to see where the food was and if I need to come outside (I have Covid and was in bed in my pajamas but was willing) and she just screamed at me on the call and claimed she’s never had so much trouble finding a building. 
Like I intentionally made it hard for her. 
Like real screaming. 
She also hung up on me in the first and second call. 
Finally got the food and it’s ice cold.

1731259099.0,How can I help you?,"I'm looking for advice from dashers, not to bash anyone. I order out a lot and live in a condo ""community. The order of units is not super-intuitive and the lighting is less than ideal. I know this makes delivery difficult, which is why 95% of the time, I try to meet the driver at the street to collect my food. I provide very clear directions to my unit in the notes section, but learned years ago that dashers don't usually have access to the notes. If they do, hardly anyone reads them. So if I want to dash, I plan on going outside to collect the food. I never tip less than $10. If the recommended tip is more than $10, I will add at least a few bucks. I am kind and respectful to drivers and don't waste their time. 

What happened last night wasn't an isolated incident. I was standing at the entrance to the ""community"" where the sign makred with the address is. I was holding my phone up with the flashlight on. I was careful not to shine it directly at the car as it approached but I was still clearly visible as he drove past me into the parking lot. I start walking toward the parking lot and I see the driver pulled over behind some parked cars with headlights flashing. 

As a customer, I can never be 100% sure that the car I""m looking at is my dasher. There are not signs on the cars or descriptions given. It seems unwise to startle someone by walking up and tapping on their window. I stand at a respectful distance, waving my phone to indicate I am looking for someone. The driver just sits there, so I'm thinking maybe he's not the person and I'm freaking him out, so I start back to my condo. Then I see him get out of the car. Now I have spent several minutes walking around in the dark and it is raining a bit. I approach him and tell him my name. He confirms he is the dasher. Then he wants me to wait while he gets his phone out to take my picture. At this point, I was frustrated and told him to go on, but he kept following me, insisting he neeeded the picture. I held up the bag and said ""take it."" He kept going on and on explaining to me and I""m standing here in the rain with a bag of cold food and I say again ""go ahead and take it!"" until finally he does. I regret the tip, which was double what was suggested but oh well, that's the way it goes. What is the point of this when both the driver and the customer end up being unhappy? 

Is there anything I can do to make these deliveries more convenient for the dasher? I am willing to do my part to make these interactions better for all, but I am at loss as far as what else I could do. Thank you for any advice.

Suddenly realized it had been a while and looked back at DD. Driver hasn’t moved at all. Checked and it’d been 30 mins since pickup. 

I waited a couple more mins and saw the driver wasn’t moving whatsoever. So I text asking if everything is OK but get no response. I considered calling but the app says the driver speaks Spanish. 

So I reach out to support. By now it’s been 40’minutes. They try to reach out but can’t reach her. 

Then support just ends the chat on me. So I had to start again. 

I tell the new guy it’s now been 50 minutes. He reaches out to her and says he did reach her but he doesn’t speak Spanish either. I assumed DD support would have a Spanish agent call but whatever. 

So I’m getting nothing from support and the app still shows the driver in the same spot like 10 miles away. 

The agent asks me if I want to cancel for a full refund. 

I type “fine cancel and refund me,” hit enter and ding dong. Someone’s at my door. Sure enough it’s DD with my food. 

I tried to talk to her but she spoke no English. 

By the time I get back to my phone I see in the chat the agent tried to confirm with me that I wanted to cancel then closed the chat. 

I divvy up the food between my wife and myself. It’s not as hot as I’d like but it’s otherwise fine. As I eat I check the app again. I get a notice my order was cancelled. I didn’t get a refund but was given a $10 DD credit. 

So, is it likely my driver got in trouble? Did she get paid? ",doordash,1,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gnub4a/weird_experience_today/,True,,hiirogen,1731219351.0,,,False

I didn’t expect that I would get such a heavy order like that but, it took so long to check out at the store because the manager had to confirm all the electronics (understandably). Then it took even more time to carry the two water packages to my car.

 I ended up using every fiber in my body and carried it to my car(took a little while).

1731204929.0,Serious Scam involving dashers!,"So this happened a while ago but I need to let you guys know about it being a Dasher. I got a very small order but the tip was good so I figured what the hell let's go as always. Soon as I reach the pizza restaurant somebody had ordered a 50 cent cup of ranch sauce. I thought it was odd but as soon as I walked out of the restaurant after pick up doordash called me. 

The caller ID picked it up a doordash as usual and the guy on the end instructed me to sign out of my doordash and he let me know that the previous order was canceled and they will be compensated me with $8 not bad at all. He then he told me because of my ratings which are pretty high that I would be receiving a $400 bonus never hearing about anything like this and told him hell yeah. 

He needed to verify me by needing to verify the amount I had in my instant dash card so I told him. Then he instructed me that they needed at least $200 in my direct dash account to give me the $400. Which I didn't have at the time he added that I could add cash through cash app or PayPal to up it. 

At this point I got suspicious and started to call them out they told me if I didn't they could not verify me and I would be deactivated I called bs. I told them there are many ways to verify me included my personal information that I supplied with the company and they should do so he abruptly hung up. 

Upon calling the doordash number back it was deactivated. So what I took from it is somebody made a order for a small item and canceled it upon my arrival using a fake caller ID they named themselves doordash. They were trying to extorting a couple hundred dollars off me using a different payment means as you can't do that with direct Cash card

Ordered DD as I'm a bit hungover still. He arrives to my apartment building (easy to get to as there is a pull up spot right off the street (temp spot usually for cars/uhaul of people moving In and out of my building and  one beside mine)

Most dashers park there, come in and bring up to my apt door. This guy I could tell by his name wasn't English native and after a few min pass I look at GPS again and see he's walking up and down the street bs coming into my building he is parked in front of. (Hence I send the text)
He still asks Me to come down. Annoyed I throw on a Hoodie (I was shirtless in bed) and walk down. I meet him out front of my building (he's by his car a few feet away.

I go to grab the food and he says 'no, picture first' I said 'take a photo of me grabbing it from you' he says 'pic at door' 

I walk to front door as I thought that he wanted pic there. No. He waits on me to OPEN door he couldn't read instructions to himself and follows me upstairs back to my apt 😂
Takes pic there *still not even getting unit # which was on the door, he zoomed in on the food by the bottom of door.

I almost reported him, but the poor guy will likely get reported soon enough anyways if he has more of these type of interactions. Customer Assisted doordash for ESL dashers 🤦‍♂️

Menu prices of what I'd want to order on my weekly cheat day always far exceed $20, and most Saturdays the other stores have deals going. So I rarely eat Taco Bell. 

I was just wondering if this was a regular thing for DashPassers, or if it's more specific to my area. 

I have a 50% off coupon from DoorDash, limited to $20 off.

Nothing from Taco Bell keeps in the fridge.

Bottom line is I feel like I'm getting a bigger bang for my buck from every store *other than* Taco Bell, even when I have a 50% off coupon for any order from any store.

1731122839.0,Help from a Customer,"Hey Dashers,

I’ve had a lot of awful dashers and barely use the app, but today I was unintentionally an annoying customer and wanted to shoutout to all you good drivers and ask if there’s a way to increase a tip? I was always told there is, but can’t find how…

Long story short, I always in the past have got notifications on every step of the delivery from when the restaurant received my order, from when dasher picked it up, to when dasher is ALMOST here, to when dasher IS here, and then inevitably when they text/call me manually to get in the gate if I’m not already out there waiting. I ONLY got the first 2 of these - when dasher picked it up, and nothing else.

I did NOT get the “dasher is almost here” text (usually when I go down to meet them at the gate, unless I’m working and on a work call, in case I hope and pray it’s unlocked and they come to my door, else I say BRB and run out to pick up my food when they’re here) so I thought I had time to take out the trash quick. I live in a busy beach downtown area. Traffic is shit. Parking is shit. I didn’t think it was unusual not to get the text yet. I left my door open and only had my screen door closed, so anyone who came to my door can see everything in my house.

LO AND BEHOLD to my surprise… in the 3 minutes it took me to go to the dumpster, my food and drink was placed nicely and neatly on my doormat. I checked and got no notifications from DD. The driver even texted me on the website he was here, and I did NOT get notified of that either. He was a G and didn’t open my screen door to do anything bad and left my food thoughtfully.

I can’t even say thank you and apologize because he marked it delivered. I want to double my tip but can’t find out how

Also a reminder that us annoying customers don’t always mean to be annoying 😭 I used to Postmate long ago when that was still around, so I get it…

I took screenshots of how much the food prices are to pick up from the restaurant, and how much it would be to have delivered via DoorDash. 

The meal went from $12.59 to $16.34 ($3.75 increase).

The 2 count strip went from $4.05 to $5.25 ($1.20 increase).

The small Mac and cheese went from $3.59 to $4.65 ($1.06 increase).

The Parfait went from $4.99 to $6.49 ($1.50 increase).

The meal total for pick up came out to $27.26 while a $0 tip delivery came to $42.78 ($15.52 difference excluding a tip). This is a 64% price increase which is INSANE!!! 

I’m not a driver but I can totally see why people leave 0 tips with a 64% price hike.

1731049841.0,What are the consequences for drivers refusing to deliver based on tip?,"So here was the situation I dealt with today.
I am a restaurant manager. Today a customer calls in and asks to speak to a manager. She tells me she has been waiting an hour for an order she placed through our website because the delivery keeps getting delayed despite having an assigned driver. 
The way that works is the customer places their order in our site and the delivery is provided via DoorDash. This is so we can run our own promotions and can refund orders if we need to for one reason or another, granted the issue is our fault in said situation. But DoorDash is responsible for anything related to the delivery. 
So I tell her we did make the food and it’s been ready for pick up. So if there is an issue with the delivery she needs to call DoorDash. 
So she hangs up to do so. Then she calls back and tells me apparently the driver has been sitting outside in the parking lot but refusing to pickup the food because he isn’t happy with how much “we” are paying him for it. I say “That makes no sense. We don’t pay him… DoorDash pays him…” and she says “Well he just gave me an attitude and said that because I called him he is gonna stay there as long as he wants.” At this point I am assuming she either stiffed him or was gonna leave a crappy tip. Either way, this isn’t my problem. We made the food and had it ready for the driver. But now SHE wants US to compensate her somehow because even though she gets that DoorDash is responsible for the delivery, we use them as a delivery service so we should take responsibility for this. 
I could have told her this isn’t my problem but I decide to be nice and tell her I will call DoorDash and get THEM to compensate her because we didn’t do anything wrong here, therefore there is no reason for us to swallow the cost. 
So I call DoorDash support and tell them what is happening. The nice lady on the phone tells me to hold so she can call the driver. Sure, no problem. I hold and she gets back to me saying the driver didn’t answer the phone and just cancelled. Coulda done that from the start, buddy. So now they are looking for another driver. I ask the lady “Well are you going to compensate the customer for all this?” She informs me that if someone does, indeed, deliver the food, they will not be refunding her. So I say “Then would you kindly call the customer and explain that to her?” So she puts me on hold again to do so. Lady comes back and says the customer cancelled the order, and that they will be compensating us for the food. Fine by me. I thank her and end the call. Then the customer calls me once more and tells me she is sending someone to pick up the food. Great. We still get paid and she gets a free $200 order. Alls well that ends well I suppose. Sept for the time I had to spend fixing this problem for her because the driver wanted to play games. 
So my question is… do drivers not face consequences for this sort of behavior? I can understand not taking a delivery because of a bad tip or no tip. But he literally sat in the parking lot for an hour for the sole purpose of making problems for the customer and us. Do drivers just not fear getting terminated off the app? Or is this something they get away with? Can anyone provide some insight?

1731045836.0,"I thought it was a Scam, turned out to be legit!","Accepted a Rusty Taco order for two tacos, Chips & Queso for 9 miles, $14.25 and dropping me into a decent area of my zone. Minutes after accepting DD Support calls. I immediately was on alert as Support very rarely calls us in the middle of an order. Support asks me if I am able to complete the order. I was like yea, why wouldn’t I complete it? He then tells me, this order is for an “Elite” customer (huh?) and if I complete it he will ad $13 to my base pay. I was certain this was a scam and next he would be asking for my account info to “verify” instead he just says Thank you and please keep updated and says good bye.  I hung up not believing a word and continued to drive to the restaurant while calling DD support myself. The agent started laughing when I told her what had transpired stating DD does not call to add money to the base pay, which I knew. I have 14,500 deliveries under my belt. Then as I’m talking to her, I get another incoming call from “DD Support” I told the support agent they were calling back and that this is where they will try to get my account info because they are having trouble depositing the $13 lol. I didn’t answer the call and support didn’t see anything suspicious about the order so she said I could continue with the order if I wanted to and felt safe. Well I carry a Glock so I wasn’t too concerned. And I figured the order would magically get canceled since I didn’t answer when they called back and still get full pay. :) it didn’t get canceled. Dropped off the order it was a leave at the door. And got paid the original $14.25 so I just blew it off. 

That night when I went to transfer my earnings from my dasher direct card to my bank, there was exactly $13 more in my account than what my earnings were for the night??

I looked at my earning tab and sure enough under “Other Pay” it said “ Extra Delivery Payment” $13

This was not an “add on” tip. It was paid from DD! 

So, I have no idea who I delivered to in Xenia, OH but DD paid me well for it. I was doing EBT. the base pay was $7.25, they tipped $7 and DD PAID an additional $13! 

No complaints here! :)

1731039138.0,Horrible Driver Experience,"I ordered from a restaurant online, and they outsource to DoorDash for delivery. The dasher texted me that they were at my pinned location which I couldn't choose and told me what car they were driving after I asked them since I didn't see them. They ignored my calls and messages and didn't respond until after the 5 minutes passed that they claimed DoorDash gives them to hand off the food. In my delivery preferences on the restaurant, I specifically said to hand it to me so I don't know if that was communicated, but that wasn't done. To help them find the address, I even sent them the location on Google Maps, and they didn't respond or reply. Does anyone else think they took the food?

1731036269.0,Should I report my driver?,"I don’t have a screenshot as this did not happen today and I can’t find the screenshot I took when it did. 

I am a 27 year old single woman who lives alone in an apartment complex that’s hard to get into so I usually go down and meet my driver outside to get my food. On several occasions, my dasher has messaged me after the fact hitting on me and/or asking what I am up to that evening, which makes me very uncomfortable given that these men know where I live. I never respond.

Guy friends have told me to report them when this happens. I agree that I should to stop them from doing it to other girls. My concern is that they will know it was me who reported them and, again, they know where I live (and I also don’t want to potentially take away somebody’s livelihood for sending a stupid message).

I guess I am just asking what would you do in this situation? If I reported them, would they know it was me? Would they get banned for this? ",doordash,7,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gm96lk/should_i_report_my_driver/,True,,EndElectrical2908,1731036269.0,,,False
1731035662.0,DoorDash Deactivated Customer Acct,"Went to order food and got a weird error and was signed out. Check my email and see my account was deactivated for a “safety violation”… we do not even interact with our driver as we have our order left at the door .  When I called customer support they could not provide any details because there was none other than the account was deactivated for a safety violation… told me they would escalate to a manager, and would receive an email detailing the issue . Been days still havnt heard anything … what possible safety violation could have occurred ? 

Update: after calling three more times and getting hung up on, I finally got a rep that said “ All I can see is that the safety violation was reported by a dasher, sometime last year. “ 

She couldn’t tell me or likely see exactly what it was other than a dasher report. I asked why is it that I get a single unverified report and it takes a year to deactivate the account, why is it that I have reported at least two drivers for flat out stealing my entire order and marking it delivered , or clearly have gone through the bag and yet I’ve had those same dashers several times thereafter … of course I got no response other than, I will escalate this and look for an email within 24/48 hours… this is the exact line I got Monday and it took me calling 3 times on Friday to even get this far …

So DoorDash believes;

-The accused has no right to appeal or even know what the accusation was, if you are a customer you are guilty no matter what.

- Customer complaints on a dasher are not true because the dasher would never do anything wrong.

- That I don’t realize that I was paying less for DoorDash pass every month due to a promo and not the current price , and that they trumped up some fake complaint to deactivate my account so that I would loose the promo and have to pay the going rate again

- when asked , the rep said you can create a new account but with new info… you would need a new phone number , email, and address. A NEW ADDRESS!!!

- when asked is the account ( email, phone, and address) banned for life or just a period of time … answer was for life .

- rep then advised , calling multiple times in a week will not change the answer, and there are no appeal processes, once the answer is final it is final …

1731033297.0,Doordash keeps asking to verify card but won't take it,"Hey all. Doordash recently flagged something (I ordered a gift and food for a friend in the same day, so I'm thinking it was just too many orders) on my card and I can't seem to resolve it.

It's just a normal debit card, nothing weird about the account or the bank, never really had issues. The problem is that it wants me to scan the card so that the card number is visible, which would be fine, except a lot of cards have stopped printing the number on the front, including the cards from my bank. The card number IS printed clearly on the back, but the prompt specifically says to scan the front, and no matter how many times I scan the back it says card could not be verified.

Support just keeps telling me to scan again and it will work or to change banks lol. Again the card is totally normal, I use it every day, but I can't seem to get past DD thinking I don't have physical possession of the card when it's right here in my hand.

Any advice? Is there some email I can just send a photo of the card to or any tricks to actually make the card scan go through when using the reverse side of the card?",doordash,2,3,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gm882o/doordash_keeps_asking_to_verify_card_but_wont/,True,,ilulillirillion,1731033297.0,,,False
