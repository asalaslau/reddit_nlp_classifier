I‚Äôve noticed that some restaurants on the app, you cannot choose water as your drink with your meal. For example I‚Äôm currently ordering Taco Bell and I can‚Äôt select water as my beverage for my Deluxe Cravings Box. The only options are heavily sugared drinks.

In store I can substitute with water, but on the app, selecting a drink is mandatory to continue and water isn‚Äôt listed. Would this be a DoorDash not allowing substitutions, or a restaurant issue not listing water as available? 

Side note, I think every meal should at least offer water as a substitute choice, it‚Äôs the most basic necessity.

So he sees a previous delivery at the wrong door and gets mad at me because it throws him off I guess. I've tried hard to find a way to fix this to either turn that off or to make the picture the correct door/location to no avail. The issue is definitely on his end and it's annoying to order food for the dasher to complain about something I have no control over.

1731896172.0,Stacked Orders,"I am so sick of Door Dash stacking orders. I assume that's what the term is for what happens to my orders. I order something, it gets picked up immediately, and then the driver goes in a completely different direction, waits for a second order, makes a dropoff, then gets to me like 20 minutes later.

From what I've read, DoorDash does this to stack up orders of non-tippers with tippers, to give an incentive to grab both. I tip pretty well and my food almost always gets picked up very quickly. If a driver is \*really\* fast, I sometimes add a few extra bucks. Easy orders -- a house with no complicated instructions, etc. 

The drivers say that the tip is less option and more of a 'bid' for them to take the work. And I'm actually fine with that. It makes sense. The problem I have is, the tip is not always commensurate with service. Why should I tip more if DoorDash just sends a driver on a second order before mine?

I have had great drivers deliver my food quickly. Tonight, this guy has had my food in the back of his car for 20 minutes. Probably not even his fault. It's ridiculous. Assuming I'm interpreting it correctly, DoorDash needs to stop with this stacked order garbage.

1731894293.0,Why are drivers so bad at finding addresses?,"I was lazy today and ordered DoorDash twice, once for breakfast and another for dinner. This morning my dasher (who has delivered to me 4+ times before) parked across the street from me. I figured she would see me and just walk over but alas she did not. Instead she calls me and proceeds to repeat over and over again that she does not speak English only Spanish. So I then proceeded to wave my arms around like the wacky wavy inflatable arm guy for several minutes until she looked over and saw me. Then she sends her what looked to be 10 year old kid over to bring me my food never actually getting out of the car herself. 

Then for dinner I tried ordering again and again got another dasher who has delivered to me multiple times. He proceeds to park across the street from my building as well about a half block up from where I'm at. Then he calls me to tell me he's there and I explain I'm actually across the street several houses back. I'm also again already waiting out on my front stoop in anticipation of my delivery so I wave at him thinking surely he sees me. He says he does, great he'll be there in a second. Wrong. Apparently he saw people sitting on another stoop in the complete opposite direction and starts heading there while I'm trying to shout at him from across the busy main street. He did not hear me so I had to call him back and explain that he went the wrong way until finally he realizes his mistake and heads over. He even comments as he's walking up to me oh I should have remembered I've delivered to you a bunch in the past. 

So I just wanna throw this out there for any DoorDash drivers reading this. In America many cities will number housing on certain sides of the street with all odd numbers or all even numbers. Please familiarize yourselves with this so when you see a delivery to 1234 Main Street you know which side of the road to deliver on.

Now I literally do platinum orders all day. I decline everything. Sure I get a few hours that die down per day but that was the same when I was platinum too.

1731860076.0,Detailed Delivery Instructions and still delivered to wrong house,"Hey Door dash community,

I placed an order last night and it got sent to my neighbors (who I'm not cordial with and wouldn't trust with my food at all). It isn't the first time this has happened but the first time the dasher told me the location ping was at their address. I checked and it didn't appear to be but I edited it to be sure. 

Ive also seen people suggesting you should include in the delivery notes detailed instructions in case the ping is wrong. Since then I've always left very specific instructions to avoid confusion (ex: please leave on the green chair, we have a no soliciting sign in the window).

Yesterday I ordered and the picture showed the driver left it at my neighbors on the floor outside their door. Someone brought my food back and rang the bell (also in my delivery instructions not to do since we have a loud dog). I'm suspecting it was someone staying at my neighbors (I think they're away) and fortunately the food was still sealed so I don't believe it was tampered with. I'm just frustrated because I'm not sure why I'm tipping a driver beforehand for them to still not follow clearcut instructions.

 I know doordash is cut throat and people don't make a lot of money. I feel bad filing a complaint and maybe getting the delivery driver in trouble. I have no proof they corrected their mistake because the picture shows it at the wrong address - and that is also their proof they correctly delivered, which obviously they didn't. DD hasn't prompted me to rate the delivery which I find odd but I'm not well versed in doordash and it's workings. 

I'm just conflicted because I don't think I should be paying for a wrong delivery when I've done everything to make it clear where I'm located. Just wondering what delivery drivers think about this as you have insight into the other side. Could it be this is just a doordash bug or was the driver just neglectful? I just don't want to be unfair to the delivery driver if this wasn't explicitly their fault.

1731840783.0,DoorDash Deactivated me. ,"**UPDATE:** I should have clarified this earlier‚Äîmy stats plummeted after I moved to a city I won't name in North Florida from Orlando. In Orlando, I had a 95% acceptance rate, 100% completion rate, 99% on-time rate, and a perfect 5.0 customer rating. I was thriving there. But since moving, my experience has been terrible, and so are my stats.

The traffic here is a nightmare. Every day, I either witness an accident or a close call. This city consistently ranks in the top 15 for worst drivers in the US‚Äîwith a little research, you'll figure out which city I'm in. Food is almost always late, making multi-apping a risky move. Drivers are either painfully slow or dangerously aggressive. In one week alone, I've nearly been hit three times by people blowing through stop signs. GPS here is useless; I'm constantly having to call customers for directions. It‚Äôs one thing for GPS to be off occasionally, but here it regularly drops me in the middle of nowhere.

I've been dinged with low ratings for things beyond my control. A leaky cup holder (I ended up buying my own off Amazon), a duplex with the same unit number and street name as the one two blocks over. Why would you have two identical addresses within a 3-block radius? 

Once I arrived at an address with three identical food orders already sitting outside, making mine #4. After leaving, I get a call from the customer saying she never got the order. After a bit of research, I realize that all the food I saw was from her constantly having to reorder her food because her address doesn't show up correct in the GPS because there's a house with the exact address as her duplex a block away! 

And don't even get me started on trying to deliver to trailer parks in the middle of the night when you can't even see the address/unit on the trailer. It's been a nightmare.

So yeah, judge me all you want. I'll take it. But this low-stat performance is a recent phenomenon. A month ago, I drove back to Orlando and my stats improved in just those two days, so I'm not just imagining things.

Anyway, I'll take the L. DD has been a real pain here, and honestly, I'm over it now. My instacart stats are fantastic, and I'll just have to drive back to orlando to work and get my UberEats stats back up. I'm planning on moving out of this crappy city as soon as I get my finances back in order. 

**ORIGINAL POST:** I worked for DoorDash for over a year, consistently going above and beyond for customers. At the time of my deactivation, my acceptance rate was around 45%, customer rating 4.7, and completion rate was 93% with 2 contract violations‚Äîone which was removed after a dispute.

DoorDash has been a stressful gig. Most zones near me don't pay well. The only zone that does requires scheduling a week in advance, which needs to be done between 12am and 4am, as they fill up fast due to market oversaturation.

The app is glitchy. It often freezes, kicking me out of my scheduled shift. If I pause for a few minutes, it sometimes ends my shift early, and driving out of my zone for 10+ minutes can do the same.

I was deactivated for late deliveries. I‚Äôve stayed late at restaurants to ensure customers get their orders, even when previous drivers failed to deliver. DoorDash staff told me this was okay, but it seems to have impacted my Completed on Time rating, which was around 75%. If there was a threshold for this metric, I would have appreciated knowing, so I could have avoided waiting and declined those orders.

I requested an appeal, but it was denied without explanation. I‚Äôm frustrated because I had shifts lined up this weekend that I now can‚Äôt work.

I used to dismiss complaints about DoorDash on Reddit, thinking people weren't being honest about their performance. Now, I get it. DoorDash demanded more from me than I ever did from them. I worked hard because they paid better than UberEats locally, despite fewer orders. Now, I‚Äôm forced back to UberEats, where the rates are terrible‚Äîlike $3 for 15 miles.

I chose gig work to escape the usual workplace issues. The appeal was the control over hours and earnings, even if the pay wasn't great. Now, right before the holidays when I need money most, I can‚Äôt work. DoorDash turned out worse than any brick-and-mortar job‚Äîthere‚Äôs no HR or warning, just a sudden deactivation that leaves you unemployed.

My advice: take the complaints on Reddit seriously and protect your job. Ultimately, the best job is one you control. I‚Äôm making changes to ensure I‚Äôm never this dependent on a company like DoorDash again. Take care.",doordash,59,19,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gtb3ue/doordash_deactivated_me/

We picked up the pizzas and headed there and once we got there they asked us to go up on stage, while we were up there the preacher started his sermon and had us talk about why we are doing doordash and just general life questions. After it was all over he asked what was the biggest tip we've ever gotten, we responded by saying ""$50 because it was a catering order"" and he told us that he would guarantee to surpass that. He then set a jar down and asked people to come up and if they'd like they could tip us. We started crying and they prayed over us. In the end we finished with $1,429 from a $2 order.

1731795528.0,I'm so confused about tipping...,"It used to be possible to tip upon placing the order, or upon delivery. Then it was changed to ""you can't tip before delivery"". So I'd just have to tip in the app right after seeing the delivery person or pay in the app after grabbing my food if I opted for contactless non-interaction.

Last year I had an issue where I couldn't tip at all even after delivery, so I did a live-chat and the support person applied the tip for me. They asked, and I sad ""please apply a $5 tip to this order for the dasher"" (in not so many words).

Okay, so you can't tip while waiting for the order or before pick-up and delivery. Fine, it's not really logical to tip until after I receive my food. Last night I place a double-dash order so in this case I definitely want to tip properly. As the man was approaching my door, I try to give a tip in the app and it doesn't work. I get some error message. 

So luckily, just in the nick of time I give the man a $5 bill.... that's something, but it's not enough for shuffling to 7-11 while also delivering my Chinese food. So I try again in the app, I try to tip both orders... both give an error. The next step, reach out to support.

I start a live-chat with a chat-bot which eventually gets me a human keyboard operator. Must be a keyboard operator because all they did was read me the policy about how you can't tip before the dasher pics-up or delivers the food. It's as if they didn't really read my issue. So, I reiterate... and hten the person tells me **""it's too late to tip because you can't tip after the order is completed""**.



I'm so confused. **Can't tip before but can't tip after, either?** I'm sure I'm just missing something obvious, but this is feeling a bit unnecessary complicated for me as someone who just wants to no screw over any person who delivers food to my door. Can anyone please help me understand this before I reach out to support for a third time (which precedes a formal complaint, which sux bc that doesn't get a fair tip to the dasher).",doordash,3,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gsyk1m/im_so_confused_about_tipping/

1731790381.0,How to consider appropriate/fair tip for Delivery App Drivers.,"This is a guide that just helps people consider a fair tip for their order so you are likely to get quick and efficient delivery.

1. The most important aspect of calculating a tip for Doordash, should mostly be based on distance and time the driver will have to go. So if you are ordering from a Restaurant 5 miles away and it normally takes 10-15 minutes to drive there, the tip should reflect that. Consider the driver needs to wait on the order. A minimum tip in this scenario should be $5(all of this is based on assumption that the delivery is done correctly and all instructions are followed aka a good job).

2. Order size should only be factored into your tip if the order is heavy or larger than normal. A 15+ item shopping order is absolutely something you should be factoring into your tip. Time is $.. ordering 1 tiny thing from CVS should not change anything when it comes to tipping based on time and distance. 

3. Time of day and traffic need to be factored into your tip. If you live in a densely populated area, that is prone to traffic and has parking difficulties, and your order during Rush Hour, please consider the extra time and effort the driver will need to exert for a delivery like this.


These 3 things are the main considerations to take into account if you care about tipping fairly and appropriately. This is not a thread to argue about tipping or exact amounts. It is just a basic guide to help regular people understand how Doordash drivers can be fairly tipped and what to consider when tipping. That is all. I feel like many people do not understand how to tip app drivers, and many customers have asked me about this, so I thought a simple guide could be helpful.

1731739860.0,"Okay, I think I need technical help","I commented on someone else's post earlier today, which ended up becoming a big long back & forth with several other people. In a nutshell, it's sounds like either my app is glitched, or else I am simply not understanding the rating system. So here goes ...

My total number of customer ratings suddenly dive bombed this week. I have approx. 750 lifetime deliveries, and as of last week I had 99 customer ratings. (I don't recall the exact breakdown, but it was like 98 were 5-star and 1 was 4-star. Something like that.) Meaning, my average overall rating was like 4.98 or something. Suddenly, at the start of this current week, my total number of customer ratings is only 10, and my average has gone up to 5.0

After speaking with a few other dashers here on this subreddit, I got the impression that my app might be glitched. So I chatted with 3 different support agents tonight after my dashing was done, but they all told me the exact same thing: 1) If I think my app is glitched, do this list of troubleshooting steps. [Your basic clear cache, uninstall and reinstall the app, etc.] Well I did the entire list of things like 3x and it didn't help. Which brings us to 2) All 3 of the agents I spoke with told me that customer ratings ""roll over"" after each 100 deliveries. I talked around and around and around with all of them, explaining that I wasn't talking about the AVERAGE, what I was talking about is the BREAKDOWN, or the individual total ratings. But they would just repeat the same thing, that it refreshes after every 100 deliveries and the ratings restart at zero.

By the time I was done with the 3rd support agent, I was thoroughly confused. So that's why I'm turning to my fellow dashers... can you please help me understand?

(The screenshots are of just one conversation I had with support, but all my conversations basically went the same way. I'm pretty sure they were talking about AVERAGE rating, and they were not understanding that I was asking about the BREAKDOWN.)

background: dd for 1 year on/off; 400+ deliveries

southeast usa, big city

* your acceptance rate matters; they look at it to see how well you are dependable. They may not say it, but they are watching and will give you better deals and orders ""invisible hand"" 
* As a 1099, part time, just do the taxes on turbo tax and take standard deduction. I dont track all that bullshit.
* Use the doordash debit card and keep all expenses on that, for work, lunches/dinners on shift, etc. Even groceries. 
* Work peak hours AMAP, its worth it then. I made like 65-70 in 3 hours last saturday 07:30pm-10pm
* Try to do it part time, 05:30-08:30 is great.
* working class people TIP GOOD they are your street friends. dont expect rich folks to tip.
* Keep a kind demeanour about you even if you are cranky or tired, be non-judgemental and offer resolutions to customers that are speedy and in their favor. 
* More importantly, stay consistent don't just have a shitty night and quit. Keep at it
* Maintain your acceptance rate above 70, don't decline unless you have an emergency, and even take the shit long distance order that's 15 miles for 8 bucks time to time. I find the algo takes me to busier zones and I just switch zones wherever I land.

Far from the case.

Typically any night of the week I make $70-$150, started dashing at 3PM and stopped about 8:30 and I never even made it to $30 that entire time. Offers were far and few between, a crap ton of no-tip offers. Got a crap ton of lowball offers for like $6 wanting me to deliver 8+ miles away. My AR tanked big time this evening. I typically keep it 85%-90% to maintain platinum status so I can decline crap offers. Ended the night with my AR at 73%. 

I got so many $2 no-tip and $3 offers it was f'king ridiculous. I've never declined so many offers in one night, most evenings the offers are great and don't have to decline any. I don't get what the deal was this evening.

1731712192.0,Double charged ,"TLDR- Doordash had double charged me $300 and denied ever doing so. 

I posted this last week to this sub but I was stressed out about this whole situation to make any ounce of sense.

On Halloween, I had ordered about $300 worth of groceries. I did this because I have a significant back injury and no car. While the driver was shopping, something wasn't available so the price changed/went down. I was like sweet, thanks for the heads up and the dasher had changed it from the app and at the end of the whole order, the amount was corrected to the right amount it was supposed to. 
The next day, I looked at my bank account and saw the adjustment price was already posted on my account. The Saturday morning afterwards, I looked at my bank account and saw that there was a pending charge on my account for another $300. So I called Doordash to see why I was charged again, and when I called, they explained that it was the adjusted price, i told them it wasn't, that it was already posted and that this was a completely different charge. 
When I sent them a screenshot of my bank statement and then I was then told ""No, we didn't charge you that"" even though the new pending charge was the exact same amount and says the exact same thing. When I pointed it out to them and that if they could do anything about it, I was screamed at to ""Fuck you and your payment, it's not our job to figure that fucking shit out."" I had that said to me twice by two separate people trying to figure out why I was charged.

for context i live off campus with no meal plan and have no drivers license or car (being used to the MTA).  i got student dashpass last year after a friend recommended it to me and this was my first experience w/ doordash bc it was always so expensive.

normally i try to keep it small and order fast food combos and tip $2 because i can‚Äôt really afford anything else but this sub has illuminated to me how little my dashers have been making on my cheap taco bell and pizza orders, and i now have a lot of guilt about my inability to be a good tipper as an unemployed student.

my questions are: does dashpass mitigate the lack of tip in any way? would you accept for ex. a biggie bag order with $2 tip if the wendy‚Äôs is 1.2 miles away? lastly should i order DD less frequently as to not burden dashers with my bad orders?

1731691877.0,Restaurants beware!,"I work for a small chain sports bar and we have been getting hit with a specific scam. The full order comes in to the kitchen no problem, but on the tablet, it only shows the customer ordered a side of sauce. It is SIMILAR to the other side of sauce scam they‚Äôve been doing but it‚Äôs different in this sense-

The kitchen received a full order of food with a specific customers name from DoorDash. Multiple entrees. Kitchen starts to prepare as normal. 

As orders are set to automatically send to the kitchen because we get a pretty good to-go business throughout the day, upon reviewing the order, it‚Äôs just a side of cheese sauce  which is $1. 

Here‚Äôs my hypothesis:
The customer makes their order as normal, and has a pre-loaded script to run, that deletes the full cart, adds a side of cheese sauce to the cart, while the 1-2 second payment processing window is happening. So the ‚Äúsend to kitchen‚Äù function is happening before payment is confirmed somehow. 

We‚Äôve been hit for quite a pretty penny on this. Not gonna share numbers but it was hefty.

1731608757.0,Door Dash is so bad‚Ä¶ it might be good. ,"Advice on how to make sure as a customer, your orders are correct?

I door dash daily because I was signed up for the annual dash pass without my permission, and when I tried to cancel it within 10 minutes of noticing the subscription charge, they refused. So, I decided to use it as much as possible in the year to get my moneys worth. 

I am not joking when I say for every 10 orders I do, maybe 2 or 3 are correct. Only 1 or 2 of 10 ever come as a complete order with utensils and everything. 

It is my go to now to send a message that says ‚ÄúHi (dasher,) please double check for (drink/side/food/etc) and utensils as (restaurant) usually forgets. Thank you so much!‚Äù As a way to cover my bases as the customer. 

They usually always respond with ‚Äúwill do‚Äù but my orders still arrive wrong. I always report it for the difference back, and since I‚Äôm a frequent user they often throw on an apology credit with the refund. So i realistically get a lot of things for free because door dash hires incompetent people. 

My question is: what else can I possibly do to ensure my orders are right? I feel bad that the company has to refund me every other day, but I‚Äôm also not paying for items I didn‚Äôt receive‚Ä¶ like paying for a large $7 soda and getting an empty cup and no straw.

1731603011.0,Spending on service,"I‚Äôm a dasher and a doordash customer often, So I understand both sides of wanting tips and not wanting to spend a lot on delivery by giving a low tip. But the thing is, you pay for your food and the service if you want it delivered. Doordash also is a corporation so they‚Äôre going to obviously take their cut whether or not you agree it should be lower so they can pay drivers more. I understand the regular definition of a tip as being an extra if you receive especially good service, so on doordash I think using the word tip when in actuality you‚Äôre paying to receive the service in the first place instead of giving extra for good service, is a misnomer because it leads some customers to believe that it‚Äôs an extra payment for good service when in reality it‚Äôs going to be the majority of what a dasher makes and should be based on how badly you need something delivered and how much you think a dasher deserves for completing a service for you. I agree that it should be doordash paying us but the fact is that they aren‚Äôt.

Not everyone engages in your vice and it causes active harm to some people. Stop it.

Sincerely,

A Dasher & DoorDash customer who ISN'T nasty.

1731506216.0,Driving vs Parked Getting Orders,"I have 2 major hotspots in my zone where I return to and park if orders are not coming in. They are about 4.5 miles apart on each side of the city. I know when each is busy and at what time, so I coordinate accordingly. There are other hotspots, but those are unimportant for this story.

I swear that Doordash wants me to drive around burning gas for no reason!!! I can be sitting in one area with no orders coming in and the very second I pull out to leave or shortly after, to go to the other side, they start bombarding me with orders from the side I'm leaving. And vice-versa! Never fails. Yesterday lunch was over, and things slowed down, so I was halfway to the other side. They started sending order after order, like they were trying to get me to come back while I drove to the other side. They didn't stop until I made it! I know dang well, there were more than enough Dashers available on that side that were without orders.

The point is that I can sit and not get any orders, and then shortly after I start driving, bam!!

Seems like Doordash just wants me to burn gas or wait until I'm miles away from the restaurants / area before they want me there! ü§£ü§£

And I have a pet peeve anyway. If I am tired of an area and I have decided to move somewhere else and I'm moving away... don't be sending me orders behind me unless they are worth $20 or more... because I'm not doing any u-turns, waiting on stoplights, or pulling into parking lots to turn the heck around. FIND SOMEONE ELSE! ü§£ü§£ If you can't send it to me while I'm there, oh well!

1731504918.0,Question for everyone unhappy with DoorDash,"So like, I was a Dasher and used to use DD for a number of years when I owned a business in which I could not leave to get food, and it was a nice perk to offer my employees. It‚Äôs gone downhill fast in the last year or so, not sure if those of you who used it when it was first out agree that it was better, service wise?

My question is though, why aren‚Äôt we, unhappy customers and dashers as a whole kinda doing anything about their absolutely horrible downturn in business practices? Like tanking their ratings on all possible platforms, App Store, BBB, wherever is possible to leave DoorDash a rating? 
I know it feels like nudging their 4.8 star rating on Apple App Store from over a million reviews seems pointless, but like‚Ä¶ if enough folks do something, and explain why they‚Äôre so unhappy‚Ä¶ maybe something will give?

I dunno, I just am so dejected that a service I was once really happy with has gone in the toilet. And every time I read about something awful happening to someone on here and DD customer service not doing anything and not caring‚Ä¶ I feel worse. I am upset for everyone who is done wrong. I feel like something must be able to be done‚Ä¶there has to be.

1731481779.0,Disconnect When Ordering From Restaurant And Delivery From Door Dash - Wendy's,"This has happened to me for the second time. I placed an order through the Wendy's app. It asks me for delivery instructions, I write in where to leave the order, and to please not ring the bell. The order is sent to Door Dash for 3rd party delivery, and I get a notification there are missing delivery instructions. What it wants is an apartment number which they don't need as we live in a house. But then I see under further instructions it says ""hand to me."" I edit that and put the same instructions in for where to leave the order.

I have a sick husband freshly home from the hospital and two large dogs (who rightfully scare the crap out of people) who aren't fans of people coming to the door. I just want a simple, hassle free delivery to feed me and the kid.

The driver comes up to the door (I am watching on the camera with the dogs in another room hoping to avoid a fuss) and he bangs on the door. About two seconds later he is ringing the bell, then bangs again, and rings the bell TWO MORE TIMES.

I open the door a crack - the dogs are losing their minds - and say ""please leave the food on the chair, per the instructions."" And close the door. And go back to watching the camera. He looks confused, then a bit pissed, and turns and looks as though he's going to walk away with the food. Then he yells at the car ""get my phone"" before putting the food on the chair, giving up on whoever he was yelling to, and leaves.

Where is the disconnect? I don't know if I should be upset with the dasher for not following instructions or upset with Wendy's for not relaying information, or with Door Dash for not relaying information. But I can say it has happened twice now when ordering through the Wendy's app.

To a lesser degree, I have always wondered why it was such a big deal on their end whether the order is left at the door or handed off. If handed off they don't get any kind of proof. They know they handed it off but they don't take a picture of the customer or get a code or anything that would prove they handed it off. So if something goes south it's kind of a he said/she said situation. But if it's left per the customer's instruction they have to take a photo.",doordash,3,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gq7b29/disconnect_when_ordering_from_restaurant_and/

1731393297.0,Possible Scam: Customer's Perspective,"Wanted to share in case this helps anyone/ wondering if anyone had a similar experience.

I order a bag of dog food through Petco, which uses doordash drivers.

Right as the order was supposed to be delivered, I had two calls come one from a man followed by a woman within minutes of each other asking if my order had been delivered. They both hung up quickly after I told them no, but the map shows it should be soon. The woman claimed that the driver said it had been delivered. I don't recall giving them any personal information, but may have confirmed my phone number? I don't recall.

Shortly after I got a text from petco saying my order was delivered and to call my dasher ""Robert"" if there was any issues. I had not recieved the item, and when I called the number it was an old lady who did not know who Robert was.

I called doordash support, they said that they had not called me. They said they had a different number on file than the one petco's doordash number provided me ( I know this is petco's number as they provided me with the doordash tracking and I've gotten order texts from them before). They did not recieve a picture from the driver. They dispatched a new dasher.

The new dasher called me from Petco saying that Petco gave my dog food to the first dasher an hour prior and that I need to call Petco support to dispatch a new order, so the new dasher could not even pick up my order despite already being there, so they had to cancel my order. I felt bad for the dasher who drove there with no order to pick up, but she was very understanding about it.

Given the discrepency in the phone number for the initial dasher, I'm pretty sure the dasher just stole it. But maybe someone scammed the initial dasher and changed the numbers? Why would ""doordash"" call me to ask if the order was delivered?

1731390592.0,FT KNOX DOORDASHING,"Hey everyone. I did doordash awhile back in London, KY. I recently relocated to Elizabethtown, KY. I started doordash again over the weekend and only got 38 orders toward my 100 to get platinum perks from Friday to today (Monday). There must be a ton of dashers in Etown because it hardly let's me dash now during lunch and dinner rushes, and when it does, it's only for 30 minute increments then cuts me off. Even scheduling doesn't have Etown hardly until like 4-5 days later with awful times for example of 2-330 am. I have a full-time job Tuesday-Friday from 7am-5:30pm, so I'm just dashing after work and of course Saturday-Monday when I can.

The reason I started dashing again is because the paychecks from my regular 40 hr job are literally gone every week. It takes every penny I have to afford my bills. I've made a lot of dumb choices with loans and credit cards, and when adding rent, car payment, insurance, utilities, etc I am 100% broke on Fridays. When I say I don't have a penny left from those checks, I mean it. While I'm not too upset about being broke because all my bills are paid which is most important for me, it's really hard to do anything else. I can't even afford a McDouble if I wanted it and occasionally it does get frustrating and mentally exhausting.

That being said, I relocated here to start a life with  my girlfriend who I had a long distance relationship with. She's literally the best thing that has ever happened to me and I know people say this all the time, but this woman truly, TRULY!!, saved my life. She got me away from all the bad stuff I was doing and still loves me solely for me and nothing else. She loved the good and the bad and doesn't judge me in the slightest for my past. She's the biggest blessing aside from my daughter that I've ever received in my life, and I'm extremely grateful to have her and try my best to make sure she knows everyday she's alive how beautiful, amazing, and loved she is by me.

All that sappy stuff aside lol, I am doordashing to save up to buy her an engagement ring. The one I want is $1500. I made $254 last weekend, and I'm trying my hardest to make the money by Christmas. I am willing to work my ass off to achieve that, honestly. I just want to make her happy is all.

I was hoping someone in here is from the Etown area and could tell me what dashing on Ft. Knox is like and if it's worth it. They are always showing as either very busy to busy the entire day. It even let's you schedule the entire day the next day from 7am-9pm instead of 4-5 days later like Etown does. I'm pretty sure they're open to dashing from 7am-9pm everyday, but I may be wrong. I know you have to go to the visitors center to get a 1 year pass, I do know that.

My main question is, do they order a lot from places on base, or is it mostly off base then back on? I really don't want to have to go to Etown and back over and over 100x a day. Radcliff wouldn't be so bad, or on base even better. My brother works for the DoD and has to go in office 2 days a week on base and he said the MPs are really strict about speeding as well so much so that he said they've pulled people over and immediately searched their car. Are they really that strict? I just don't see it being worthwhile to drive to say Dunkin in Etown from base then back for $5.50 and also always looking over my shoulder to get pulled over doing 37 in a 35. If anyone has any experience there, please let me know so if it's worth it, I can be down Saturday to get my pass and hopefully make some good money to get closer to getting this ring.

Thanks so much guys. Yall are awesome",doordash,1,0,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gpdzhr/ft_knox_doordashing/

1731318265.0,DASH HACKS,"I just wanted to offer up a few tips and tricks I've picked up over nearly 1k dashes. I've made some damn good money when I had to. Dash during prime time! Lunch and dinner; there's usually a good 4-4.5hr window for both depending on your market. Try to hang around areas with alot of dining options, from fast food to sometimes fine dining. Try to avoid areas that you know don't, or probably won't tip. Every city has bad areas. Don't be afraid to decline the BS  Try to accept orders that average  $1.50+/mile; that's really the only way to start making decent money but it's honestly not always possible to do that. Now if a $20 15 mile order comes in, I'm prolly taking that, and if it's a slow time of day, I'll take some BS just to pass the time it keep my rates up. If you have to pause your dash for a short bit to get back to a good zone, then do it. Look at the customer instructions and map before you leave. GPS isn't always right and if you know the area, short cuts can save you so much time. Especially during rush hour or in high traffic areas. TIME IS MONEY! Communicate with the customer via text from wait time to eta with the order. I get so many added tips and cash tips just because I communicate, and sometimes BS with the customer. Most importantly, please take your appearance, and your vehicle's if possible, seriously. Nobody wants someone who looks like they smell funny handling their food lol. Be friendly and smile with your entire face; body language speaks volumes. Just remember that ultimately, we're in the customer service business. It feels like I've been rambling, but it's because stuff just kept coming to me and I'm sure there's more. There's definitely money to be made if you really want to make it. I hope this helps.

1731281196.0,Terrible dasher experience ,"Just got my order a few mins ago, and the dasher had over 15,000 deliveries with a 4.8 rating. And the result is a pizza that looked like it wasn't taken care of at all during the delivery process. I don't know how it's possible to have that many deliveries as a dasher and not know pizza needs to be handled horizontally when delivering? I had to rewind security camera footage to see what happened and this dasher on his bike handled the pizza like it was a book. Also, when he took it out his book bag vertically, he proceeded to shake the pizza box as if it that was going to help. SMH. I did get my money back after sending photos to customer service, but this shouldn't really be happening.

Update: I've added camera footage of this great dasher, to back up my claims. I'm saddened that there are people who actually defend this type of service as being acceptable.

I don‚Äôt have a car and I have physical limitations so this has been a great option. I always tip despite the fact that there is apparently an hourly rate and always tip pretty well. Just getting that out of the way. I placed an order from a grocery store that had a fair amount of items, nothing too crazy‚Ä¶ I see the Dasher that accepts the order is on a bike apparently. Assuming that the little icon thing that DoorDash shows is accurate. It takes this person quite a long time to reach the grocery store and by the time they do, they call me angrily saying that I ordered too much for DoorDash. The person had very broken English, but I kept telling them to cancel the order and they never did but acted as if the majority of items were out of stock‚Ä¶ they were definitely not the kind of items that would be out of stock. My order total was about $100 and they delivered maybe a third of it. I had already tipped and I was pissed off about this. Customer service was essentially useless, but after badgering them a few times they gave me DoorDash credits to make up for the balance. What happened here? Doesn‚Äôt the Dasher see what the order is? And if they can accept it? Like I would assume that some people avoid orders from certain stores because it‚Äôs too out-of-the-way or they don‚Äôt want to go there or whatever. Why would this person do this?

I used to hardly ever have to ask for a refund, and I would NEVER ask for one if the order wasn‚Äôt messed up.

1731266763.0,What happens when you complain about a driver?,"I‚Äôm just curious what happens when you complain about rudeness? 
I had a driver that couldn‚Äôt find my building and called me. I kept trying to tell her how to find it, she was talking over me, yelling at some points. I suggested she just go back and look at the map at the entrance.
She didn‚Äôt want to do that. She wouldn‚Äôt stop talking long enough to explain it.
I have never had anyone that even remotely has a hard time finding the building and I tip A LOT. 
I door dash once a week and no issues.
It took her almost 30 minutes to find the building. I finally called her back to see where the food was and if I need to come outside (I have Covid and was in bed in my pajamas but was willing) and she just screamed at me on the call and claimed she‚Äôs never had so much trouble finding a building. 
Like I intentionally made it hard for her. 
Like real screaming. 
She also hung up on me in the first and second call. 
Finally got the food and it‚Äôs ice cold. 
I‚Äôd like to complain but I don‚Äôt want her to get suspended or anything like that. Even though it‚Äôs wrong. She really shouldn‚Äôt be screaming at customers.

1731259099.0,How can I help you?,"I'm looking for advice from dashers, not to bash anyone. I order out a lot and live in a condo ""community. The order of units is not super-intuitive and the lighting is less than ideal. I know this makes delivery difficult, which is why 95% of the time, I try to meet the driver at the street to collect my food. I provide very clear directions to my unit in the notes section, but learned years ago that dashers don't usually have access to the notes. If they do, hardly anyone reads them. So if I want to dash, I plan on going outside to collect the food. I never tip less than $10. If the recommended tip is more than $10, I will add at least a few bucks. I am kind and respectful to drivers and don't waste their time. 

What happened last night wasn't an isolated incident. I was standing at the entrance to the ""community"" where the sign makred with the address is. I was holding my phone up with the flashlight on. I was careful not to shine it directly at the car as it approached but I was still clearly visible as he drove past me into the parking lot. I start walking toward the parking lot and I see the driver pulled over behind some parked cars with headlights flashing. 

As a customer, I can never be 100% sure that the car I""m looking at is my dasher. There are not signs on the cars or descriptions given. It seems unwise to startle someone by walking up and tapping on their window. I stand at a respectful distance, waving my phone to indicate I am looking for someone. The driver just sits there, so I'm thinking maybe he's not the person and I'm freaking him out, so I start back to my condo. Then I see him get out of the car. Now I have spent several minutes walking around in the dark and it is raining a bit. I approach him and tell him my name. He confirms he is the dasher. Then he wants me to wait while he gets his phone out to take my picture. At this point, I was frustrated and told him to go on, but he kept following me, insisting he neeeded the picture. I held up the bag and said ""take it."" He kept going on and on explaining to me and I""m standing here in the rain with a bag of cold food and I say again ""go ahead and take it!"" until finally he does. I regret the tip, which was double what was suggested but oh well, that's the way it goes. What is the point of this when both the driver and the customer end up being unhappy? 

Is there anything I can do to make these deliveries more convenient for the dasher? I am willing to do my part to make these interactions better for all, but I am at loss as far as what else I could do. Thank you for any advice.

Ordered breakfast from a place 11 miles away. Tipped $15. 

Got the ‚Äúyour order has been picked up‚Äù message a little while later. Looked at the map, saw the driver was moving toward me but still had a ways to go. Went back to scrolling Reddit. 

Suddenly realized it had been a while and looked back at DD. Driver hasn‚Äôt moved at all. Checked and it‚Äôd been 30 mins since pickup. 

I waited a couple more mins and saw the driver wasn‚Äôt moving whatsoever. So I text asking if everything is OK but get no response. I considered calling but the app says the driver speaks Spanish. 

So I reach out to support. By now it‚Äôs been 40‚Äôminutes. They try to reach out but can‚Äôt reach her. 

Then support just ends the chat on me. So I had to start again. 

I tell the new guy it‚Äôs now been 50 minutes. He reaches out to her and says he did reach her but he doesn‚Äôt speak Spanish either. I assumed DD support would have a Spanish agent call but whatever. 

So I‚Äôm getting nothing from support and the app still shows the driver in the same spot like 10 miles away. 

The agent asks me if I want to cancel for a full refund. 

I type ‚Äúfine cancel and refund me,‚Äù hit enter and ding dong. Someone‚Äôs at my door. Sure enough it‚Äôs DD with my food. 

I tried to talk to her but she spoke no English. 

By the time I get back to my phone I see in the chat the agent tried to confirm with me that I wanted to cancel then closed the chat. 

I divvy up the food between my wife and myself. It‚Äôs not as hot as I‚Äôd like but it‚Äôs otherwise fine. As I eat I check the app again. I get a notice my order was cancelled. I didn‚Äôt get a refund but was given a $10 DD credit.

He needed to verify me by needing to verify the amount I had in my instant dash card so I told him. Then he instructed me that they needed at least $200 in my direct dash account to give me the $400.

So what I took from it is somebody made a order for a small item and canceled it upon my arrival using a fake caller ID they named themselves doordash. They were trying to extorting a couple hundred dollars off me using a different payment means as you can't do that with direct Cash card

1731204496.0,Assisted my non native English speaking dasher to finish delivery to my Apt. ,"Definitely one of my most interesting dasher interaction experiences to date lol.
Ordered DD as I'm a bit hungover still. He arrives to my apartment building (easy to get to as there is a pull up spot right off the street (temp spot usually for cars/uhaul of people moving In and out of my building and  one beside mine)

Most dashers park there, come in and bring up to my apt door. This guy I could tell by his name wasn't English native and after a few min pass I look at GPS again and see he's walking up and down the street bs coming into my building he is parked in front of. (Hence I send the text)
He still asks Me to come down. Annoyed I throw on a Hoodie (I was shirtless in bed) and walk down. I meet him out front of my building (he's by his car a few feet away.

I go to grab the food and he says 'no, picture first' I said 'take a photo of me grabbing it from you' he says 'pic at door' 

I walk to front door as I thought that he wanted pic there. No. He waits on me to OPEN door he couldn't read instructions to himself and follows me upstairs back to my apt üòÇ
Takes pic there *still not even getting unit # which was on the door, he zoomed in on the food by the bottom of door.

I almost reported him, but the poor guy will likely get reported soon enough anyways if he has more of these type of interactions. Customer Assisted doordash for ESL dashers ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I arrived, went into lobby and they said it would be a couple minutes before the order was completed. As I sat down to wait (there was absolutely no one in the lobby) I received an additional Arby's offer, which I accepted. I informed the counter employee that the order they had just received was also mine. He said it would take a few more minutes to complete that one. I said ""that's fine"" because, of course, it would take a bit longer. About 3 minutes later, a lady walks in and orders quite a bit of food at the counter. She and I are the only people in the store. After a bit, she gets her food and walks out. I go up to the counter and VERY POLITELY ask why she got her food faster when both my orders had been placed before hers. The manager came up and explained that this was their policy because the customer at home is already waiting on their Doordash delivery and they won't notice so much that it's taking a few extra minutes. However, the customer in the lobby will notice.

Menu prices of what I'd want to order on my weekly cheat day always far exceed $20, and most Saturdays the other stores have deals going. So I rarely eat Taco Bell. 

I was just wondering if this was a regular thing for DashPassers, or if it's more specific to my area. 

I have a 50% off coupon from DoorDash, limited to $20 off.

Bottom line is I feel like I'm getting a bigger bang for my buck from every store *other than* Taco Bell, even when I have a 50% off coupon for any order from any store.

I‚Äôve had a lot of awful dashers and barely use the app, but today I was unintentionally an annoying customer and wanted to shoutout to all you good drivers and ask if there‚Äôs a way to increase a tip? I was always told there is, but can‚Äôt find how‚Ä¶

Long story short, I always in the past have got notifications on every step of the delivery from when the restaurant received my order, from when dasher picked it up, to when dasher is ALMOST here, to when dasher IS here, and then inevitably when they text/call me manually to get in the gate if I‚Äôm not already out there waiting. I ONLY got the first 2 of these - when dasher picked it up, and nothing else.

I did NOT get the ‚Äúdasher is almost here‚Äù text (usually when I go down to meet them at the gate, unless I‚Äôm working and on a work call, in case I hope and pray it‚Äôs unlocked and they come to my door, else I say BRB and run out to pick up my food when they‚Äôre here) so I thought I had time to take out the trash quick. I live in a busy beach downtown area. Traffic is shit. Parking is shit. I didn‚Äôt think it was unusual not to get the text yet. I left my door open and only had my screen door closed, so anyone who came to my door can see everything in my house.

LO AND BEHOLD to my surprise‚Ä¶ in the 3 minutes it took me to go to the dumpster, my food and drink was placed nicely and neatly on my doormat. I checked and got no notifications from DD. The driver even texted me on the website he was here, and I did NOT get notified of that either. He was a G and didn‚Äôt open my screen door to do anything bad and left my food thoughtfully.

I can‚Äôt even say thank you and apologize because he marked it delivered. I want to double my tip but can‚Äôt find out how

1731080091.0,Security escort made me late.  Deactivation pending,"Honesty, I never have issues delivering to gated communities.  Do I run into some problems?  Sure but it never ends up being all that bad.  However, there's one community that I will NEVER deliver to again.  Why?  Security escorts.

Yesterday I accepted a $7.50/3 mile order without realizing where it was going until after I picked the food up.  3 miles quickly turned into 6 because I had to go through the gate on the opposite side of the property.  Even though the south entrance has a manned gate, they only let vendors into the north gate.  I get to the gate well ahead of the drop off time but now have to wait for a security car to show up and escort me to the house.  We then drove about 15 mph around the place before I dropped off.

These people made me 25 MINUTES LATE.  It would be one thing if it was actually my fault but because of security my account might get deactivated.  Anybody else have to deal with this?

1731049841.0,What are the consequences for drivers refusing to deliver based on tip?,"So here was the situation I dealt with today.
I am a restaurant manager. Today a customer calls in and asks to speak to a manager. She tells me she has been waiting an hour for an order she placed through our website because the delivery keeps getting delayed despite having an assigned driver. 
The way that works is the customer places their order in our site and the delivery is provided via DoorDash. This is so we can run our own promotions and can refund orders if we need to for one reason or another, granted the issue is our fault in said situation. But DoorDash is responsible for anything related to the delivery. 
So I tell her we did make the food and it‚Äôs been ready for pick up. So if there is an issue with the delivery she needs to call DoorDash. 
So she hangs up to do so. Then she calls back and tells me apparently the driver has been sitting outside in the parking lot but refusing to pickup the food because he isn‚Äôt happy with how much ‚Äúwe‚Äù are paying him for it. I say ‚ÄúThat makes no sense. We don‚Äôt pay him‚Ä¶ DoorDash pays him‚Ä¶‚Äù and she says ‚ÄúWell he just gave me an attitude and said that because I called him he is gonna stay there as long as he wants.‚Äù At this point I am assuming she either stiffed him or was gonna leave a crappy tip. Either way, this isn‚Äôt my problem. We made the food and had it ready for the driver. But now SHE wants US to compensate her somehow because even though she gets that DoorDash is responsible for the delivery, we use them as a delivery service so we should take responsibility for this. 
I could have told her this isn‚Äôt my problem but I decide to be nice and tell her I will call DoorDash and get THEM to compensate her because we didn‚Äôt do anything wrong here, therefore there is no reason for us to swallow the cost. 
So I call DoorDash support and tell them what is happening. The nice lady on the phone tells me to hold so she can call the driver. Sure, no problem. I hold and she gets back to me saying the driver didn‚Äôt answer the phone and just cancelled. Coulda done that from the start, buddy. So now they are looking for another driver. I ask the lady ‚ÄúWell are you going to compensate the customer for all this?‚Äù She informs me that if someone does, indeed, deliver the food, they will not be refunding her. So I say ‚ÄúThen would you kindly call the customer and explain that to her?‚Äù So she puts me on hold again to do so. Lady comes back and says the customer cancelled the order, and that they will be compensating us for the food. Fine by me. I thank her and end the call. Then the customer calls me once more and tells me she is sending someone to pick up the food. Great. We still get paid and she gets a free $200 order. Alls well that ends well I suppose. Sept for the time I had to spend fixing this problem for her because the driver wanted to play games. 
So my question is‚Ä¶ do drivers not face consequences for this sort of behavior? I can understand not taking a delivery because of a bad tip or no tip. But he literally sat in the parking lot for an hour for the sole purpose of making problems for the customer and us. Do drivers just not fear getting terminated off the app? Or is this something they get away with? Can anyone provide some insight?

1731045836.0,"I thought it was a Scam, turned out to be legit!","Accepted a Rusty Taco order for two tacos, Chips & Queso for 9 miles, $14.25 and dropping me into a decent area of my zone. Minutes after accepting DD Support calls. I immediately was on alert as Support very rarely calls us in the middle of an order. Support asks me if I am able to complete the order. I was like yea, why wouldn‚Äôt I complete it? He then tells me, this order is for an ‚ÄúElite‚Äù customer (huh?) and if I complete it he will ad $13 to my base pay. I was certain this was a scam and next he would be asking for my account info to ‚Äúverify‚Äù instead he just says Thank you and please keep updated and says good bye.  I hung up not believing a word and continued to drive to the restaurant while calling DD support myself. The agent started laughing when I told her what had transpired stating DD does not call to add money to the base pay, which I knew. I have 14,500 deliveries under my belt. Then as I‚Äôm talking to her, I get another incoming call from ‚ÄúDD Support‚Äù I told the support agent they were calling back and that this is where they will try to get my account info because they are having trouble depositing the $13 lol. I didn‚Äôt answer the call and support didn‚Äôt see anything suspicious about the order so she said I could continue with the order if I wanted to and felt safe. Well I carry a Glock so I wasn‚Äôt too concerned. And I figured the order would magically get canceled since I didn‚Äôt answer when they called back and still get full pay. :) it didn‚Äôt get canceled. Dropped off the order it was a leave at the door. And got paid the original $14.25 so I just blew it off. 

That night when I went to transfer my earnings from my dasher direct card to my bank, there was exactly $13 more in my account than what my earnings were for the night??

I looked at my earning tab and sure enough under ‚ÄúOther Pay‚Äù it said ‚Äú Extra Delivery Payment‚Äù $13

This was not an ‚Äúadd on‚Äù tip. It was paid from DD! 

So, I have no idea who I delivered to in Xenia, OH but DD paid me well for it. I was doing EBT. the base pay was $7.25, they tipped $7 and DD PAID an additional $13! 

No complaints here! :)

Been days still havnt heard anything ‚Ä¶ what possible safety violation could have occurred ? 

Update: after calling three more times and getting hung up on, I finally got a rep that said ‚Äú All I can see is that the safety violation was reported by a dasher, sometime last year. ‚Äú 

She couldn‚Äôt tell me or likely see exactly what it was other than a dasher report. I asked why is it that I get a single unverified report and it takes a year to deactivate the account, why is it that I have reported at least two drivers for flat out stealing my entire order and marking it delivered , or clearly have gone through the bag and yet I‚Äôve had those same dashers several times thereafter ‚Ä¶ of course I got no response other than, I will escalate this and look for an email within 24/48 hours‚Ä¶ this is the exact line I got Monday and it took me calling 3 times on Friday to even get this far ‚Ä¶

So DoorDash believes;

-The accused has no right to appeal or even know what the accusation was, if you are a customer you are guilty no matter what.

- Customer complaints on a dasher are not true because the dasher would never do anything wrong.

- That I don‚Äôt realize that I was paying less for DoorDash pass every month due to a promo and not the current price , and that they trumped up some fake complaint to deactivate my account so that I would loose the promo and have to pay the going rate again

- when asked , the rep said you can create a new account but with new info‚Ä¶ you would need a new phone number , email, and address. A NEW ADDRESS!!!

- when asked is the account ( email, phone, and address) banned for life or just a period of time ‚Ä¶ answer was for life .

- rep then advised , calling multiple times in a week will not change the answer, and there are no appeal processes, once the answer is final it is final ‚Ä¶

so, on my doordash account, i have ONE saved payment method. i would also like to note that apple pay is NOT a saved method on my account, i checked the website and the app.

earlier today i used apple pay to pay for a doordash order. DID NOT SAVE MY APPLE PAY. today was our renewal date for our dashpass and apparently the one saved card on the account declined.

so what you'd expect to happen is they cancel the subscription right?

nope.

somehow, WITHOUT my authorization, my debit card linked to my apple pay was charged. my apple wallet shows that it was paid for with apple pay.

i called doordash support to ask for an explanation and for confirmation this wouldn't happen again as i'm not the main user of the account and i do not agree to be paying for the dashpass.

after a lot of back and forth, the support person basically told me there's nothing she can do and my only option is to unlink my card from MY apple pay to prevent it from being charged again.

they straight up told me that to prevent doordash from putting unauthorized charges on my cards, i need to go out of my way to remove cards from my apple wallet that i use regularly because they have no way to 'unlink' it and neither do i.

which by the way, i had no knowledge that my apple wallet was being ""linked""?? nowhere did it say that. the reason i was even using it is because i didnt want my card linked to the account and apple encrypts cards you put in your wallet.

i told them that if any other unauthorized charges get put on my apple wallet by doordash im filing a chargeback because i should not have to get rid of my apple wallet to prevent unauthorized transactions ü§∑

Long story short, after a delivery I messaged my dasher and complimented him and asked for his number. 

He called me rather then texting in the app I guess so no trail professionally and showed interest/complimented as well and we spoke for a few minutes. Lots of laughs/flirting etc. we agreed to text and set something up. 

I text that number but I think since it‚Äôs attached to the app/me it doesn‚Äôt allow things to go through after the delivery‚Äôs over? I believe they do use their actual phones but DD spoof the number maybe? It‚Äôs was his first couple days dashing so I‚Äôm assuming he didn‚Äôt know that and didn‚Äôt give the run around lol. 

He was pretty into me humbly, compliments was excited, laughing etc etc. mind you he called me, could‚Äôve just ignored my message.

You keep your spot on the waiting list and you have to wait maybe 15 seconds to a minute, but another offer will come over. The pay goes down with every order you decline, but maybe it's less packages or in an area you prefer to deliver in so it evens out 

2. It doesn't matter where you are. I've been up to 30 miles away from the dashlink warehouse and have gotten orders. As long as you're on the waitlist and on an active dash, you'll get a dashlink 

3. You don't need to be dashing in the area where the dashlink warehouse is located. I've been dashing 30 miles away, 2 areas away, and received dashlinks 

4. If you're on the 7am waitlist, keep calling and ask to be put on the 12:05 midnight waitlist. You'll get a few agents that don't know what you're talking about, will say it's automated, will tell you to check your preferences, will say they're forwarding your concern, but hopefully you'll get through to the right agent.

The reason I‚Äôm posting it is for one, awareness and two, for those like me who use both apps because we can‚Äôt choose one app only. I used to use only DoorDash but I started using uber a year or two later because the coverage area was much bigger. But after this, I‚Äôm canceling uber one, and forever staying with DoorDash.

Yall, so I ordered from ue yesterday, I got some sushi from a place that's supposed to be high rated, well.... I got food poisoning from the sushi, :|| I probably shouldn't have continued to eat it but this is like 150$ worth of sushi.
The first red flag was that when it arrived the rice was normal
temperature but the fish was hot (it's not supposed to)
The second red flag was that it was slimy and tasted past date.
The third red flag was the rice. I've made sushi in the past and have gone to many places before and ate sushi made by Japanese who immigrated here. They've taught me the secret to making rice lol. But the rice was most probably not washed. It was either undercooked or overcooked. The overcooked left a literal layer of gew on my fingers.

Anyways, so I contacted ue customer service. Ive never really had a problem with them, but yesterday and today? Oh my lawd. These hands about to be thrown. If it was 20$ I wouldn‚Äôt be so mad about not getting a refund. 20$ is a lot, but at the end of the day, I‚Äôd rather not fight it. But this came to a total of 170$. It made me incredibly sick, and am still going through it rn. I screenshotted the convo, but from my understanding is that ue doesn‚Äôt give a damn. They keep copy pasting the same thing just changing the words, and I snapped. Now they aren‚Äôt responding anymore.

	‚Ä¢	The hourly rate from the chart shows your estimated profit, excluding return miles.

3.	Add Return Miles if Necessary:
	‚Ä¢	If the drop-off is far from home or a busy area, ask your GPS or voice assistant for the extra distance and add it to the total miles before calculating earnings per mile.

4.	Adjust for Time Flexibility:
	‚Ä¢	If time isn‚Äôt an issue, subtract $0.70 from your dollars-per-mile calculation to estimate profit per mile.

While yes, there‚Äôs a time limit for accepting offers, this can be done quickly with voice assistants like Siri.

Example:

‚Ä¢	Offer: $10 for 5 miles to deliver to 13 Dasher Ln.

‚Ä¢	You: ‚ÄúHey Siri, how far is 13 Dasher Ln from home (or a busy area)?‚Äù

‚Ä¢	Siri: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 7 miles.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	You: ‚ÄúHey Siri, what‚Äôs $10 divided by 12 miles?‚Äù

‚Ä¢	Siri: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs $0.83 per mile.‚Äù

‚Ä¢	You check the chart, see it‚Äôs equivalent to around $7/hour, and promptly decline.

The DoorDash Dasher reward system has minimal impact on actual earnings, so you can safely ignore acceptance rate concerns when aiming for profitability. Through careful analysis, I‚Äôve found the rewards provided are negligible and don‚Äôt offset the losses from low dollars-per-mile offers. In many cases, you‚Äôll incur higher vehicle expenses than the income from such offers. Additionally, it‚Äôs common for acceptance rates to drop significantly throughout the year, either due to repeated low-value offers or app glitches related to connectivity.

Only an address was given, so assumed it was just a house. Arrive only to find that it's a 2 unit duplex. Customer gave no indication in the instructions or anything which unit he lived in. Sent a message asking, no response. Tried calling, didn't answer. 

It was only 2 units so figured I'll just ring the doorbell for each one and see who it belongs to. Nobody came to the door at either unit. In case the doorbell didn't work, knocked on the door of each unit. Nobody ever came to the door of either unit. Waited 30 seconds, knocked on both doors again nothing. Tried calling once more, didn't answer.

I made sure to verify I was in fact at the correct address, 100% I was. So just said screw it and just picked a porch and left it and marked it complete.

1730839129.0,"What triggers the ""youve been having issues with your orders"" message?","I order Doordash 4-5 times a month. I very rarely have issues -- the last time I reported one was over a year ago and, in my time using Doordash, I've reported 6 total issues. I ignore small things like an item worth a dollar or two missing.

The most recent one was today -- I had a small order (a 12 pack of soda and a pack of frozen sausage biscuits). I had selected substitutions for the soda, but was brought something completely unrelated (Arizona Green Tea). So I reported the issue.

Arguably, I shouldn't have, but I only received a half-refund (I'm guessing this is due to this message popping up) But I'm wondering -- does anyone know what it takes to trigger this? I don't think 6 issues over the past 3 years is too much, especially given the 4-5 orders a month.

I know the common answer on here is ""lol you're trying to take advantage"" and I don't know how I can prove otherwise other than say that I certainly have NOT done that. I tip 20% or higher on all my orders so I don't think its drivers trying to screw me.

My new place is in the woods, basically. My 'driveway' is not off the road that my house address is on, and if you use GPS it tries to take you to just the closest house on that street. my pin in the app is correct, but the gps just cant figure out how to get you there without telling you to walk through the woods. 

I have detailed instructions on how to get to my house from the main road in my delivery instructions. 

When a dasher picks up my order, I send them a map with my driveway outlined in red from the dasher app, from google maps, anything I can think of that would make it easier for them to find.

I would say 85-90% of Dashers can figure it out but there are some that just dont read instructions or dont look at their messages and will either cancel for being 'unable to find my house', or just straight up leave it at a random house.

Today was the last straw when a dasher told me to go out and find where she left my food myself and stop inconveniencing dashers by not fixing my address in the app. The issue is theres nothing to fix! My pin is exactly where my house is! 

Am I the asshole customer here? Should I just not even bother and come to terms with the fact that I can no longer use delivery apps? Is there anything else I should/could be doing to make dashers lives easier?

**Can I still not sort restaurants by distance, especially for pickup orders?** I don't want to walk too far away to pick up food due to lack of time, so when the results on both the desktop web browser and app do not allow me to sort by distance, I have to search for every restaurant I don't recognize on Google Maps just to see how far away they are from me.

I'm in San Francisco, where there are literally over 100 restaurants within a mile from me, so the results are pretty overwhelming if I can't figure out which restaurants are nearby. Right now, the top result after sorting by Pickup is 4 blocks away, and the second result is 13 blocks away.

Fine, order from the last backup that is still open. Dasher gets assigned, sweet (basically same order, small dinner, 2.8 miles, $12 tip).

Why???? Zoom in and it really looks like they are chilling in a house somewhere. I message again ""hey is everything okay? The map hasn't updated in a long time"" and this time I get a reply.

1730772190.0,BC legislation against deactivation ,"About a month ago my Doordash account got deactivated, for prolonged pickup or delivery time, which is a new policy in BC to go against the minimum earnings like Doordash did in California for prop 22. BC legislation enforced minimum earnings, but also has protection against deactivation. Companies are no longer allowed to suspend indefinitely, much like Doordash does with the 90 days between appeals, instead there is to be a maximum of 14 days before the account is either reactivated or fully terminated. 

Also, there is the policy that states that a deactivation notice must be received 72 hours before the worker is unable to accept orders. I got deactivated while I accepted an order, as soon as I accepted the order my app went unresponsive, and a few hours later I got an email I was deactivated. So there is two laws that Doordash broke while deactivating me and upholding the deactivation for so long.

Prior to deactivation I had no violations on my ratings tab, let alone the ability to dispute the violations, so in my mind the deactivation was unfair and unexpected. 

My question is if any one knows who to contact as a gig worker in BC to report the violations that Doordash has committed, and to get some protection or representation. Support won't even clarify why the deactivation was upheld, all they told me is upon review a violation occured. When I heard that I was very upset, because does that mean I got deactivated for one violation? I called multiple times to get the details and the support team tells me sorry there are no details for the violation, but they want me to trust them that the right decision was made. Funnily enough, I didn't even try to extend times for additional pay, there were just grocery store orders that had long wait times, as prior to legislation I think I received a total of 2 violations.

I wasn't even planning on reporting Doordash initially as I just assumed there was some error in the system, but after a month to just hear a vague answer telling me my account was deactivated, I need to use the laws meant to protect me an ensure that Doordash is held responsible for breaking provincial law. I already emailed Precariousworkstrategy@gov.bc.ca to report Doordash breaking the law, Does any one know of any other way to contact the government bodies that could review my complaint? I also emailed the CEO Tony, and told him about the complaints I will be reporting, as well as the inadequacy of the support team.",doordash,6,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gjvvpi/bc_legislation_against_deactivation/

They responded, ""don't get an attitude with me.""

I didn't respond. The food came, and I headed out. Turns out it was for a truck driver waiting in a parking lot. As soon as my head lights lit him up outside his rig, I knew there was going to be trouble.

I stepped out, walked, and handed him the order. ""have a nice night,"" I said.

He looked in the bag, and then back at me, ""you need to watch how you talk.""

That set me off, ""I'll talk however the f I want."" I started to back away towards my car. Making sure I was in silhouette, and that he was blinded by the head lights. He started to follow me towards my car.

Earlier this afternoon, I placed a Pizza Hut order for my elderly father to be delivered to his apt. The whole process took about an hour. The automated system sent me a text that said the driver was on the way and a second meessage  that confirmed that the order was handed to the recipient.
And it gave a phone number to call to reach the driver. So after I confirmed with my father that no food was given to him or left at the door, I called the number with my father on 3-way.
The Dasher says that she ""didn't see any apartment number"" on the delivery ticket and would be right back. Almost two hours later, nothing. Called pizza Hut and the worker says, yeah, we gave it to door dash and it's been gone.

 I got credits refunded and placed this order a whole day later, i placed it at 4pm, it has constantly been bouncing dashers, either popeyes never made my food, first dasher stole it or they lost my food, either way if its been made which it very well should have, its gonna be old, cold and probably dry too.

 The problems are so consistent on doordash, i guarantee once this order finally gets canceled or delivered, doordash wont believe me because of the consistent compensation.

I took 2 steps and anyone having issues with Doordash i urge to do the same. 

1) I filed a consumer complaint with the FTC. While the feds do not settle individual complaints, they do keep it on file and use them if a pattern emerges as part of any investigation. 

2) I filed a consumer complaint with my states Attorney General office. in my state (Maryland) its the AG office that handles consumer complaints, but other states, countries, etc may handle it differently so research your municipality.

I received a letter back from the AG office. They initiated contact with Doordash to settle the issue. It instructed me to contact the office again if I don't hear back from Doordash within a month. That month is up at the end of this week and so far nothing from DD. 

Remember, our governments are here to work for us, so may as well take advantage of their services.

if anyone is interested, I'll update again when/if I hear back from DD or after further communication from the AG office. ",doordash,7,0,0.5,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gj12e8/update_doordash_refused_my_refund_what/

My ar  was always hovering around 98.  Now still high but down a point or two every day. (I know ‚Äúpoor baby ‚Äú)
I only work lunch and dinner so dash now while nice isn‚Äôt the be all. 
My point is I feel like I am getting killed with a thousand cuts by dd. I just hate the feeling after keeping these stats for this long it will end with me scrounging around for dash time and still getting the same bad orders. 
Seriously cherry picking uber and grub hub. Now 60 percent of my money comes from those two. It was 20 percent. (Mainly uber eats)
Just seems a shame that a former top dasher and now high stats platinum gets treated like the red headed step child.

Then when he got into the neighborhood I watched him drive in actual circles. He passed my place 3 or 4 times. Finally his dot settled around the corner and I got a phone call. 

All I heard was ‚Äúno speak english‚Äù followed by a quick string of Spanish. Since the app has an auto translator I just hung up and used the chat. He never responded to a single message. After watching his dot continue to circle more I contacted support. 

I‚Äôm pissed they left me no choice but to cancel since it felt like handing this joker free $50 worth of food, but at least I could reorder with a full refund.
