1731873509.0,Customer gave me an additional cash tip that left me in shock,"  Around the time of this dash, I was really hoping to make a certain amount so I could cover rent/utilities. I logged in and immediately got a grocery store shop-and-deliver for around $10, which I was pretty stoked about. I had to drive a ways, but of course I didn‚Äôt mind. Plus, I only had to grab 2 bottles of wine, so it was quick and easy! 
When I arrived at the customer‚Äôs house, he was waiting outside for me. I scanned his ID, and he said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúI saw that I made you drive pretty far, I‚Äôm so sorry about that!‚Äù Then proceeded to hand me a $100 bill. I was in total shock- I started shaking and could only get out, ‚ÄúOh my god, are you sure?‚Äù He smiled and insisted, so I left that order with a $110 tip. 
I messaged him right away before I wouldn‚Äôt be able to anymore to further express my gratitude. What a kind dude. Little did he know, he was able to relieve so much stress I had been feeling about covering rent/utilities. I‚Äôll never forget you!!!",doordash,14,601,0.98,https://i.redd.it/s8ok3j14pi1e1.jpeg
1731806561.0,Best dash night EVER,"for context me and my mom have been dashing together to get some extra money for some trips we've had planned for a while. Today we were doing our normal $3-$7 orders (which suck I know) and we got a $2 papa john's order but we decided to take it because usually those mean cash tip. We get to papa john's and it was a 45 minute wait because the customer specifically requested for the order to be delivered at 6:15, which was fine because we had to use the bathroom and they don't have a bathroom there so we left and came back. We picked up the pizzas and headed there and once we got there they asked us to go up on stage, while we were up there the preacher started his sermon and had us talk about why we are doing doordash and just general life questions. After it was all over he asked what was the biggest tip we've ever gotten, we responded by saying ""$50 because it was a catering order"" and he told us that he would guarantee to surpass that. He then set a jar down and asked people to come up and if they'd like they could tip us. We started crying and they prayed over us. In the end we finished with $1,429 from a $2 order.

In store I can substitute with water, but on the app, selecting a drink is mandatory to continue and water isn‚Äôt listed. Would this be a DoorDash not allowing substitutions, or a restaurant issue not listing water as available?

1731840783.0,DoorDash Deactivated me. ,"**UPDATE:** I should have clarified this earlier‚Äîmy stats plummeted after I moved to a city I won't name in North Florida from Orlando. In Orlando, I had a 95% acceptance rate, 100% completion rate, 99% on-time rate, and a perfect 5.0 customer rating. I was thriving there. But since moving, my experience has been terrible, and so are my stats.

The traffic here is a nightmare. Every day, I either witness an accident or a close call. This city consistently ranks in the top 15 for worst drivers in the US‚Äîwith a little research, you'll figure out which city I'm in. Food is almost always late, making multi-apping a risky move. Drivers are either painfully slow or dangerously aggressive. In one week alone, I've nearly been hit three times by people blowing through stop signs. GPS here is useless; I'm constantly having to call customers for directions. It‚Äôs one thing for GPS to be off occasionally, but here it regularly drops me in the middle of nowhere.

I've been dinged with low ratings for things beyond my control. A leaky cup holder (I ended up buying my own off Amazon), a duplex with the same unit number and street name as the one two blocks over. Why would you have two identical addresses within a 3-block radius? 

Once I arrived at an address with three identical food orders already sitting outside, making mine #4. After leaving, I get a call from the customer saying she never got the order. After a bit of research, I realize that all the food I saw was from her constantly having to reorder her food because her address doesn't show up correct in the GPS because there's a house with the exact address as her duplex a block away! 

And don't even get me started on trying to deliver to trailer parks in the middle of the night when you can't even see the address/unit on the trailer. It's been a nightmare.

So yeah, judge me all you want. I'll take it. But this low-stat performance is a recent phenomenon. A month ago, I drove back to Orlando and my stats improved in just those two days, so I'm not just imagining things.

Anyway, I'll take the L. DD has been a real pain here, and honestly, I'm over it now. My instacart stats are fantastic, and I'll just have to drive back to orlando to work and get my UberEats stats back up. I'm planning on moving out of this crappy city as soon as I get my finances back in order. 

**ORIGINAL POST:** I worked for DoorDash for over a year, consistently going above and beyond for customers. At the time of my deactivation, my acceptance rate was around 45%, customer rating 4.7, and completion rate was 93% with 2 contract violations‚Äîone which was removed after a dispute.

DoorDash has been a stressful gig. Most zones near me don't pay well. The only zone that does requires scheduling a week in advance, which needs to be done between 12am and 4am, as they fill up fast due to market oversaturation.

The app is glitchy. It often freezes, kicking me out of my scheduled shift. If I pause for a few minutes, it sometimes ends my shift early, and driving out of my zone for 10+ minutes can do the same.

I was deactivated for late deliveries. I‚Äôve stayed late at restaurants to ensure customers get their orders, even when previous drivers failed to deliver. DoorDash staff told me this was okay, but it seems to have impacted my Completed on Time rating, which was around 75%. If there was a threshold for this metric, I would have appreciated knowing, so I could have avoided waiting and declined those orders.

I requested an appeal, but it was denied without explanation. I‚Äôm frustrated because I had shifts lined up this weekend that I now can‚Äôt work.

I used to dismiss complaints about DoorDash on Reddit, thinking people weren't being honest about their performance. Now, I get it. DoorDash demanded more from me than I ever did from them. I worked hard because they paid better than UberEats locally, despite fewer orders. Now, I‚Äôm forced back to UberEats, where the rates are terrible‚Äîlike $3 for 15 miles.

I chose gig work to escape the usual workplace issues. The appeal was the control over hours and earnings, even if the pay wasn't great. Now, right before the holidays when I need money most, I can‚Äôt work. DoorDash turned out worse than any brick-and-mortar job‚Äîthere‚Äôs no HR or warning, just a sudden deactivation that leaves you unemployed.

My advice: take the complaints on Reddit seriously and protect your job. Ultimately, the best job is one you control. I‚Äôm making changes to ensure I‚Äôm never this dependent on a company like DoorDash again. Take care.",doordash,58,19,0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gtb3ue/doordash_deactivated_me/

1731896172.0,Stacked Orders,"I am so sick of Door Dash stacking orders. I assume that's what the term is for what happens to my orders. I order something, it gets picked up immediately, and then the driver goes in a completely different direction, waits for a second order, makes a dropoff, then gets to me like 20 minutes later.

From what I've read, DoorDash does this to stack up orders of non-tippers with tippers, to give an incentive to grab both. I tip pretty well and my food almost always gets picked up very quickly. If a driver is \*really\* fast, I sometimes add a few extra bucks. Easy orders -- a house with no complicated instructions, etc. 

The drivers say that the tip is less option and more of a 'bid' for them to take the work. And I'm actually fine with that. It makes sense. The problem I have is, the tip is not always commensurate with service. Why should I tip more if DoorDash just sends a driver on a second order before mine?

I have had great drivers deliver my food quickly. Tonight, this guy has had my food in the back of his car for 20 minutes. Probably not even his fault. It's ridiculous. Assuming I'm interpreting it correctly, DoorDash needs to stop with this stacked order garbage.

The garage is approx. 5 feet to the right of the front door, and protrudes out in such a way that you actually have to walk past it to get to the front door. So it literally could not be easier or more simple to comply. But it's rare that drivers follow my instruction and then I just feel taken advantage of? Like I left you this good tip for what?

When platinum my ratio of a $2.50/mile order was about 1:13, literally awful.

I‚Äôm in Austin Texas and it‚Äôs busy as hell here.

I realized while I was doing no tip or less than $1/mile orders everyone who was available, platinum or not was getting the good $2.50/mile orders.

Now I literally do platinum orders all day. I decline everything. Sure I get a few hours that die down per day but that was the same when I was platinum too.

So while you‚Äôre doing your $6 5mile order I‚Äôm doing the $24 4mile order that was supposed to be prioritized to you.

This morning my dasher (who has delivered to me 4+ times before) parked across the street from me. I figured she would see me and just walk over but alas she did not. Instead she calls me and proceeds to repeat over and over again that she does not speak English only Spanish. So I then proceeded to wave my arms around like the wacky wavy inflatable arm guy for several minutes until she looked over and saw me. Then she sends her what looked to be 10 year old kid over to bring me my food never actually getting out of the car herself. 

Then for dinner I tried ordering again and again got another dasher who has delivered to me multiple times. He proceeds to park across the street from my building as well about a half block up from where I'm at. Then he calls me to tell me he's there and I explain I'm actually across the street several houses back. I'm also again already waiting out on my front stoop in anticipation of my delivery so I wave at him thinking surely he sees me. He says he does, great he'll be there in a second. Wrong. Apparently he saw people sitting on another stoop in the complete opposite direction and starts heading there while I'm trying to shout at him from across the busy main street. He did not hear me so I had to call him back and explain that he went the wrong way until finally he realizes his mistake and heads over. He even comments as he's walking up to me oh I should have remembered I've delivered to you a bunch in the past. 

So I just wanna throw this out there for any DoorDash drivers reading this. In America many cities will number housing on certain sides of the street with all odd numbers or all even numbers.

1731860076.0,Detailed Delivery Instructions and still delivered to wrong house,"Hey Door dash community,

I placed an order last night and it got sent to my neighbors (who I'm not cordial with and wouldn't trust with my food at all). It isn't the first time this has happened but the first time the dasher told me the location ping was at their address. I checked and it didn't appear to be but I edited it to be sure. 

Ive also seen people suggesting you should include in the delivery notes detailed instructions in case the ping is wrong. Since then I've always left very specific instructions to avoid confusion (ex: please leave on the green chair, we have a no soliciting sign in the window).

Yesterday I ordered and the picture showed the driver left it at my neighbors on the floor outside their door. Someone brought my food back and rang the bell (also in my delivery instructions not to do since we have a loud dog). I'm suspecting it was someone staying at my neighbors (I think they're away) and fortunately the food was still sealed so I don't believe it was tampered with. I'm just frustrated because I'm not sure why I'm tipping a driver beforehand for them to still not follow clearcut instructions.

 I know doordash is cut throat and people don't make a lot of money. I feel bad filing a complaint and maybe getting the delivery driver in trouble. I have no proof they corrected their mistake because the picture shows it at the wrong address - and that is also their proof they correctly delivered, which obviously they didn't. DD hasn't prompted me to rate the delivery which I find odd but I'm not well versed in doordash and it's workings. 

I'm just conflicted because I don't think I should be paying for a wrong delivery when I've done everything to make it clear where I'm located. Just wondering what delivery drivers think about this as you have insight into the other side. Could it be this is just a doordash bug or was the driver just neglectful?

Respectfully I just want to say to the drivers. Please I get it , if you need the money fair enough, but I paid a high as hell tip and priority to avoid this, and you don't HAVE to accept my order. 

So just a word of warning. I will be lowering my tip once I get my food if the temperatures aren't literally perfect ( or in this case with ice cream, not melted at all.) And that's reasonable as I paid exorbitantly for them to NOT drive around with my food once they already picked it up. 

Tldr: don't multi app on a very high tipper and then expect them to not lower their tip. Just because I tip generously doesn't mean I don't get pretty annoyed at people spitting in the face of my generosity. 

Edit: I'm a zoomer, we've failed the word literally, my point was simply ice cream soup isn't all that's neccesary for me to be upset. It being 15% melted also wouldn't be cool considering its 7 mins away and I paid for priority to ensure no stacked orders, and tipped high as hell to prevent a financial need to multiapp to survive.

1731862616.0,UK McDonald‚Äôs and deliveries - something has to be done,"I feel as though things have reached a point with McDonald‚Äôs and deliveries in the UK where it simply can‚Äôt continue.

Missing items, incorrect items, poor quality of items, missing sauces. The list goes on. 

I understand mistakes happen, but as a consumer they make it near on impossible to get compensation for these issues. I had an entire meal missing from an order a few weeks ago and the best Uber could do was offer a refund of ¬£1.80! McDonald‚Äôs aren‚Äôt interested either when I contacted them.

The real kicker is when you order directly through the official McDonald‚Äôs app rather than Uber. There is absolutely no way to report missing items or make a complaint about anything at all. You are instructed to either call your delivery driver (a joke, because they only delivered what they were given) or use the ‚Äòonline assistant‚Äô chat bot which ultimately just tells you to call the driver as well!

I did manage to get given an 0800 number which was a dedicated McDonald‚Äôs Uber Eats helpline and the lady there promised me she would refund my order within 15 working days. 20 working days came and went. No refund. I ended up doing a chargeback through my bank.

So it automatically took it out of my venmo and went through. I didn't realize that and I thought maybe they were going to be expecting cash when they got there which I didn't have. (I realize they probably don't do that but at the time I was panicking). So I cancelled the order literally immediately after I placed it like within one minute and reordered a few minutes later and then realized what had happened. I figured it was fine it'll just go back to my card. I was charged for the food and Uber eats just says sorry nothing we can do they started the food already(which is impossible). I had been just waiting for the money to go back on my card for the last few days because never in a million years would I have thought they'd charge me for it. Does anyone know if this is Uber eats doing this or the restaurant? ,UberEATS,28,0,0.38,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gtid9b/i_cancelled_an_order_literally_immediately_and/

1731812304.0,Do not use UberEATS.,"Let me explain. The service is different than it was a year ago.

If you have any issues with your order, your only option for support is text chat with a machine. This often does not understand the issue.

If you resolve it this way and get a refund, you will not get a refund for the full amount you paid. Either the delivery fee, service fee, or tip is retained by Uber.

If you order food and it says ""max delivery time 90min"" you can select priority and it changes to something like ""max delivery time 75min."" However, after you pay, the max delivery time can change to greater than 120min. Meaning if you have a schedule to keep, Uber has fraudulently represented the delivery window. Now you have to spend 30 minutes on text chat and 30 more minutes before you can leave. Costing me an hour is worth more than I paid for the food.

If you get connected to an agent (I encourage everyone to try this), they will simply pretend to not understand you while prividing prepared responses. __They will then simply disconnect the chat__.

This is unreal. Grubhub and doordash are simple, east, and accurate. They provide full refunds, do not hang up on you, and their order delivery estimates do not change after receiving payment.

I just tried to cancel an order 30 seconds or so after having made it.  After using puzzle solving skills and advanced AI to work out how to cancel the order, I finally get to an online chatbot who points out that it took me more than five minutes to cancel my order.  After several attempts I finally manage to talk to a human being.  I point out that I wanted to cancel it after 30 seconds but ubereat's systems took more than 5 minutes to decipher and use and point out that they are intentionally hard to use to the extent that it's unrealistic to expect a regular person who hasn't done it before to be able to cancel an order within five minutes.  I accept the situation and simply ask for instructions on how to cancel an order in the future within five minutes.  The helpdesk guy gives me instructions for the mobile app I believe?  I point out that his instruction don't make sense and that I'm using a desktop computer and ask for instructions on how to cancel an order in the future.  Instead of doing this he transfers me to another team.  In most companies this would mean you're going to speak to someone else immediately.  At ubereats they tell me that this means that they're going to try to respond to me somehow in 6 to 12 hours.

""Message received! We will do our best to respond within 6 to 12 hours.""

I call uber on the phone and it's impossible to get through.  There is no ubereats phone line.  There is only one for uber drivers which physically won't let you get through if you're not registered as a delivery person.

1731788852.0,Dear customers,"Hello.

Dear Ubef Eats customers.


I would like to just inform you dear customers about to search a bit more about how Uber Eats screw up drivers by giving them mostly trips like for example $3 for 20 km or $6 to do 13km and similar to this one. So my question is for you customer, will you drive that distance with your car for that money?


Many great drivers are giving up either with the time where they find out about they actually lose money cuz are doing that few cent deliveries and then after few months they are not afford to maintenance their vehicles or faster, depend of when they will find it out about they actually are not earning enough money. Many of them have no choice because they must work cuz have family, kids, bills to pay, etc. And here I believe you understand their and this situation.

Very often customers also leave negative feedbacks simply with no reason or lie to Uber Eats about the food was stolen, damaged, spilled, not delivered etc, or they decrease the tip amount to screw up the driver, with no reason, why? Mostly to get extra food or money back, and guess who suffer the most? Of course drivers. For example driver accepted the order for $9 to do 13km. So it is $3 from Uber Eats plus $6 tip from the customer. Very often customers decrease thet amount to $0, witn no reason, why? But the problem is Uber Eats is not protecting at all the drivers with this issues.

I bet other delivery companies are not better about it and probably screw up drivers in the same way, cuz why not? Nothing illegal, yes?

So how much money will you have in your pocket after this delivery for $3 or $6 minus gasoline, minus your car usage, not mention about the time which is usually between 30 to 45 min as total delivery time.

Best real and negative complaints against Uber Eats company you can find on many Facebook groups where posts with the screenshot (many of them are from USA but many also from Canada) are publication and then you will know why your order is not delivered fast enough because your order is jumping between driver cellphones and if it's similar to the ones examples mentioned above then that may be the reason. 

I would like to send here big warm hugs for the customers who give drivers reasonable tips because then YOU keep them in this business, not Uber Eats, and God may bless you for that.

All above examples I found out in Facebook Uber Eats posts and from my experience as Uber Eats full time driver. And if you want you can also read a lot about that issues to understand how actually Uber Eats company works with customers. This will help you to answer on your questions maybe about why why my food is so late delivered or maybe other issues.

1731685584.0,Flat rate nightmares (also AVOID walmart orders) ,"Last night I signed up for the flat rate ""opportunity"" of $18.50/hour. Usually, I love these. 

I accepted a delivery from walmart for their black friday deals. I get to walmart, have 2 other deliveries offered from same place, so I accept. 

The wait time to get the packages from walmart is nearly 2 hours. They are slammed and delivery drivers are definitely NOT on their priority list. I've had a few orders get cancelled, and I haven't delivered much yet (started 2 weeks ago) so my cancellation rate is a bit high. I don't want to cancel 3 more deliveries, so I wait. ..and wait. 

FINALLY get the packages, start delivering. Get finished FOUR HOURS after I accept. 

I look at the compensation at it seems.. off. I do the math. (50.23 / 18.50 = 2.7!??) 

So I fire up live chat and am told I was paid corrected ""based on their maximum compensation policies"" 

I send the screen shot for the flat rate opportunity which states online ""flat rate of 18.50/hour for active time, from acceptance to completion"". I point this out and am told that I'm wrong, and he hopes I understand. Anyone seen a maximum compensa

  
... I understand that's wage theft. (and that I live in a state that takes it pretty seriously.. I worked in payroll prior to becoming a stay at home Mom looking for extra Christmas money). 

So I call, and the nice lady that I speak to confirms that I've been paid incorrectly and I'm now on hold to be correctly paid. She then tries to transfer me to the department that can fix it. I'm currently being bounced around on hold. I get transferred again, and again, and again. Still dealing with it. 

It would be SUPER nice if they could get consistent. Pay what they're supposed to (they HAD to have lost money, I delivered an iron, a tube of OTC medication, and a book, to 3 different VERY rural addresses.... but I've delivered enough $4 orders to have made them plenty,) ",UberEATS,16,8,0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1grz9of/flat_rate_nightmares_also_avoid_walmart_orders/

For reference this happened in New Zealand Auckland, i cant seem to get help from uber support, only automated messages that cant solve the issue.

  
Basically this Delivery person told me to ""STFU"" when i tried to instruct him that the uber app shows the wrong driveway, it takes the driver to another street.

Apon checking if this person left the food in the mailbox, i noticed the packaging was tampered with. When opening my food i noticed a piece of gum inside the food... I want to make a formal complaint as i believe the driver tampered with my food being in the mood he was in..

I have a few of the ""$15 off orders of $25 or more"" promotions from people using my referral code. It used to be the case that I'd order $25 of food and pick it up myself for a total cost of around $10, usually 2 meals worth of food. 

Now any time I choose to pick it up, the promotion gets ""downgraded"" to $10 off with no warning. I check my promotions before ordering and every single one is for $15 off. Then I go and make my order and see the $15 off applied, but when I change the option to pick up, it gets changed to $10 off. 

If I cancel the order and check my promotions, I now have a bunch of the $15 off and ONE $10 off that I'm forced to use before any of the $15 promotions.
