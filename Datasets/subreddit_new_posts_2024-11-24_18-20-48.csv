1732420795.0,$180 groceries stolen from DoorDash delivery driver.,"$180 groceries stolen from DoorDash via Walmart delivery driver. 

Ordered groceries to be delivered from Walmarts app since I am super super sick and both my kids (4 and 1 year old) have pneumonia right now. 

I got a text saying the groceries have been delivered with a picture of just a black screen. I opened the front door within 1 min and nothing was there. I went to the back, nothing. We‚Äôre in Norval and there‚Äôs not many houses at the bottom of the hill here.. I walked around to every house and nothing, no groceries anywhere. 

The app shows the driver stopping at the intersection then ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù. I called Walmart to let them know and they told me I have to wait 7 business days for a refund. So not only did I not have the food I ordered (baby supplies, dinner ingredients among other things) but I also did not have the money. Zero compensation was offered by Walmart for the ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù (being robbed) after speaking with a manager. They just continued to apologize and say the refund will come soon. What a scam. 

So many people are struggling for food right now. I can‚Äôt imagine if I did not have a vehicle or if that was my last $180 to spend for food for my children! Explaining this to them, they offered no solution. They didn‚Äôt care if I didnt have a way to get food to my children last night or no money to get it after it was taken from me for the next 7 business days.

Luckily I have a vehicle and it wasn‚Äôt my last dime, I went to the grocery store and got the things I needed but I CANNOT IMAGINE if this had happened to someone without the means. What an absolute disgrace this was.

I have the drivers name ‚ÄúHasil‚Äù and apparently they use door dash drivers to deliver their groceries. 0/10 would never recommend or trust this service again.

But hey if you‚Äôre looking for free groceries, be a door dash driver for Walmart and they‚Äôll just brush it off after you steal them! Huge scam.

So I ordered Wendy's tonight. It was through the Wendy's website, but they use doordash for their orders. The first guy who picked it up sat there for five minutes, and then suddenly, our order went back to ""confirmed."" This happened three more times before I finally called the fourth guy and asked if he could message me and let me know what was going on. I figured maybe some of our order was 86ed or something. 

As it turned out, it was much worse!

Fourth driver texts me back and tells me my order was picked up. He is the fourth guy to ask for my order. It was given to the first guy. I'm pissed! 

I check outside one more time, but I know it's fruitless. Someone took our shit. So I call the support number, which seems to be through Wendy's  and not Doordash. Nothing makes sense, at this point. I have to plead my case for a refund, hoping they don't think I'm just some jagoff trying to get a free meal. No, that would be the first driver for my order, I guess. 

Anyway, I got my refund, but I want to know if there's any real penalty to drivers who do this. We ordered again at a closer place, and gave a cash tip to the kind lady who finally gave us food, an hour and a half after our first order. I love and appreciate all dashers, you're the reason I don't go hungry when my brain is failing me. I guess I've had a hard week, and I want to know if there is any justice to this.

Eventually, I filled my debit card and DoorDash charged me 9.99. There was zero option to cancel my subscription, and they continued to charge me until eventually they got the 9.99. Keep in mind, I did not OWE them 9.99, they were charging me 9.99 nearly every single day in order to renew my dashpass. I called support, waited nearly 20 minutes for assistance with horrible hold music, and yet, within minutes of me entering the line with the operator I was refunded my 9.99, as if this is a constant issue for them.

I can‚Äôt imagine how this affects those who have yearly subscriptions, and I can‚Äôt imagine how many people don‚Äôt recognize this or don‚Äôt call for their refund.

I looked on my bank app today and saw DD took $9.99 for the dashpass. I thought it was a bit odd because I could've sworn I they took it already at the beginning of the month. I usually only ever subscribe to anything at the beginning of the month anyways so that it's easier to track. I dug further and found that I was being charged $9.99 on the 3rd of the month and $9.99 again on the 23rd of the month for the past 3 months! I also remembered that I recently had a new debit card issued with a completely new number and even a new pin, & I had yet to add any subscriptions to the new one aside from Amazon. I haven't even used DoorDash in months. I thought maybe someone had somehow gotten my info, but when I checked on *MY* account it said DashPass currently active. I canceled immediately of course but I'm confused on how they even got the card info because 1. I never added my new card and 2. the new card isn't even showing up on my account in the app. The only thing I can think of is Apple Pay, but I've kept notifications on for every transaction & it also doesn't show up in my transaction history anyways. Doesn't show up on subscriptions under my icloud either. Chat support couldn't tell me any info on that & they simply said it was ""just an app glitch.""

A separate issue is drivers not being able to understand or speak any english.

All evidence suggests that all they do is screw over customers and drivers all while the corporate do nothings get bonus's year after year. The customer gets overcharged for a less than satisfactory service because they stack low pay orders with high pay to subsidize them. Then they brutally underpay their drivers who are supposed to be contractors, but in reality are employees without any of the benefits and DoorDash takes advantage of this with things like acceptance rate. An independent contractor chooses to not accept the job because it's not profitable They should not be punished for it. If a customer steals food with the hand it to me option that should not fall on the driver DoorDash should require a photo or customer verification code. The hand it to me option is only there so customers can steal food and then DoorDash can blame it on the driver and use it as an excuse to terminate their account whenever they feel like it.

Recently, my account was unjustly deactivated for ‚Äúprolonging pickups and deliveries,‚Äù but this claim is false.

Here‚Äôs the truth:
1Ô∏è‚É£ I was never given any prior warnings about delays.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Delays were due to restaurant readiness‚Äînot me.
3Ô∏è‚É£ GPS tracking logs often placed me incorrectly, showing I wasn‚Äôt at delivery locations when I was physically there.
4Ô∏è‚É£ I maintained a perfect 5.0 rating from customers.

I was using Earn by Time in the days leading up to my deactivation, and many Dashers believe DoorDash is exploiting this program to accuse drivers of ‚Äúmilking the clock‚Äù and deactivate them unfairly.

DoorDash, I‚Äôm calling on you to:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Reopen my case and conduct a transparent review with clear evidence.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Address issues with Earn by Time and faulty GPS tracking that are leading to unjust deactivations.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Improve the deactivation process to allow drivers to correct issues before being deactivated.

If my account is not reactivated, I will pursue arbitration.

To the public and fellow Dashers: If you‚Äôve experienced similar issues, I encourage you to speak out. Let‚Äôs bring attention to these unfair practices and demand accountability from DoorDash.

1732268952.0,Miles and time driving to you for a 2 dollar tip? Please STOP ,"PLEASE someone tell me why people think it's ok to tip us DD 2 dollars and expect us to drive 8 miles (25 minutes) just to turn around to go back to the area we are scheduled to dash in. 

For an example .... I get a order and don't approve it by scores go down. But when I do approve the dash I drive 2 to 4 miles to the restaurant, wait times can be 1 to 25 minutes, then I have to drive 25 minutes to your home just to turn around and drive 25 minutes back. Since DD gives us TWO dollars per trip that equals to 4 whole dollars for over an hour of my time and gas. 

If you can't tip, please order yourself and take an hour out of your day so we don't have to work for free. 

Also, TURN ON YOUR LIGHTS AT NIGHT. if I have to drive around for an extra two or three minutes just to find your house with no numbers on it don't get mad if it accidentally goes to the wrong house. 

Tip your driver's at least min wage for the time they drive to your home and the time it takes to get back to their original location. Doesn't matter if I'm picking up a catering order or one soda. I'm still doing the same efforts with my time and gas. 

If you live 30 minutes from the restaurant you choose... Tip your driver 15 dollars. That way we can make 17 dollars for that hour it took to bring YOU your food.

What sucks about that, 8 miles out of my zone, is a $2.00 pay cut in minimum wage due to it being a rural area.

When I was only about 3 quarters of a mile from the customer, I hit extreme traffic. I initially thought there had been an accident but it turns out when I slowly had gotten closer, a lady in a high vis vest told me there was some sort of food pantry event going on that was blocking up the main road making traffic coming from the direction I was coming from basically unable to move. Let it be known that this was the direction that the in-app Navigation was telling me to go. Also this area is a semi-rural area so basically if I did turn around to find another way it would have taken another 20 minutes to get around to the customer from another direction so I would have been late either way. 

I contacted support while I was waiting and told them that traffic was at a stand-still, but that my ratings would not be affected for this order. So finally after about 50 minutes of slowly inching forward I got through and delivered the order which was only a shake and a pie.

I thought I was gonna be good after what support told me but I still got a CV and submitted a dispute. Extremely ridiculous that something completely out of my control can get me a CV but here we are. Got a fat 20 dollars though from EBT though from sitting for so long though so I guess I'll take that.

I'm still relatively new to dashing (only 1 month, ~200 orders) so if I should have done something different let me know.

1732176209.0,I wasn‚Äôt hired and I don‚Äôt know why. Can I get them to change their decision?,"About 1.5 months ago I was driving home from a concert going about 38 over the speed limit and got a ticket. First and only moving violation at all. I have the opportunity to either pay the ticket or show up in court to dispute it, but the court is 4 hours away so I pay the ticket and move on. 

Cut to now, I try to apply for DoorDash and they say they are pending my application. I was super scared that they‚Äôd say no, especially since I wanted a job that was easy, that paid decent and I could choose when I work and DoorDash was just what I was looking for. However, many others on Reddit and other sites said they had speeding tickets before and were still hired, especially if it was only a single one. Some of them even had DUIs at one point and still got hired. After that I had hope. Then I got an email saying I was not hired and my account would remain deactivated, and I‚Äôm really upset because that was the best looking part time job opportunity I had going for me.

3 questions: 

1. Why wasn‚Äôt I hired when so many others were despite the same thing?

2. Will taking courses to remove the points from my license or waiting 2 years for the ticket to move off my record change their minds?

3. Why did the others get hired but I didn‚Äôt?",doordash,7,0,0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gwb9pi/i_wasnt_hired_and_i_dont_know_why_can_i_get_them/,True,,metulhedcentral,,,False

1732075593.0,Did this Dasher have a strategy?,"I just had an order take over an hour to get to me. It seemed like the Dasher waited at the restaurant a long time, and the delivery time kept being pushed back. Eventually the driver left the restaurant and made it to my apartment. It seemed like they parked but never moved from the car, unless they left their phone in the car. They then drive away without marking it as delivered or communicating with me at all. I wait a few minutes to see if they forgot, and I run downstairs to see if my meal was delivered. I don‚Äôt see it anywhere, and I even walk down the block to see if it was accidentally delivered to the wrong building. I don‚Äôt find it, so I contact the driver who is now quite far away and driving in what seems really strange ways.

I contact support, they try calling the dasher who doesn‚Äôt answer, and they cancel the order, give me a refund, and extra credits which is awesome. But I am starving and now the restaurant is closed and anywhere else that appeals to me is also closed.

I am happy with the result from DoorDash, but I am just wondering why the driver would behave this way? Why not mark the order as delivered and why not respond to me? Maybe they delivered it to the wrong building and I could have a conversation with them to figure out where exactly so I can run and grab it. Perhaps I am being too pessimistic but not marking it as delivered and not responding to me nor the agent seems really suspicious. Is there something dashers could get in trouble for that they try to avoid by not marking it delivered?

1732074041.0,Need help figuring what to tip,"So after reading a few posts on here, I think maybe I am calculating my tip incorrectly when I order on DD. I usually tip between 20-25% of the cost of the order before taxes and fees, with a minimum of $4.50. I don‚Äôt usually order from restaurants more than 5 miles away, but do occasionally order from as far away as 10 miles.  So for a $30 order from 5 miles away, I would tip $6.00-7.00. I also factor in the time of day because if I order during a busier time, I assume there will be more competition for drivers, so I might increase my tip slightly in order to entice a driver to accept it. 

But some commenters are saying I should calculate the tip based on the mileage the driver has to drive. I live in a populated area with restaurants all around, so I don‚Äôt think a driver would have to drop my order and then drive 5 miles back to get another order.

1732073501.0,I had my order stolen by the dasher for the first time in years ,"I‚Äôm so mad right now. I have used DoorDash for 4+ years and have spent thousands on dollars (not proud of it). Tonight was the first time I ever had my food stolen. I received the delivery confirmation alert and saw the photo that proved my food was at the door. I went downstairs, turned off the porch light, put some dishes away and refilled my water bottle. This only took a few minutes. By the to me I‚Äôm ready to head back upstairs I see that the dashers headlights are still shining on the house. I thought ‚Äúhmm that‚Äôs weird why would they still be here‚Äù. Opened the door and the food was no longer at the door. 

I‚Äôve never had this happen before so I was confused. I looked around outside to see if it got blown away (üôÑ) or something and sure enough nothing. Their car was driving away when I opened the door. 

I‚Äôve had issues before with orders but usually they have been parts were forgotten by the restaurant or the wrong food delivered and customer support has always given be a refund for the items that weren‚Äôt delivered, ect. Now this doesn‚Äôt happen often. It‚Äôs been almost 5 years so I feel like having mistakes happen every so often isn‚Äôt a big deal? 

However when I submitted my request for a refund it was immediately declined since the Dasher had proof of delivery of the food at the door. And no I don‚Äôt live in a building or neighborhood where people could just walk by and pick up the food. I messaged the dasher to ask her if she stole my food, she never responded. I was able to submit another request in which I was able to provide a summary of what happened. It was declined a few minutes later. I decided to call the customer service number because this was a bunch of crap. The guy didn‚Äôt speak great English so that made it hard to understand him but I explained the situation and he just said since it was reviewed twice and rejected nothing could be done. 

I just wanted my refund for that order so I could reorder the food. Even though I was upset about it being stolen, I was fine with just reordering without a second charge.

Why do I say this?? 

I work at a restaurant bakery. We sell a lot of bakery items made in house, so sometimes..we don't have them. So sometimes dashers have to try and contact the person who ordered(to see if they want a refund on that item or to replace it) and they just..don't respond. And it's usually something small like a muffin, or a slice of pie. (But there's been a couple times we didn't have peoples whole orders, because it was busy and we sold all of our bakery, or the manager/baker didn't bother to make any that night) And the dashers are sitting up there waiting, confusing guests, and just wasting both of our times. This isn't to shame anyone, or make anyone feel bad! I've been perpetrator of this crime too, and I understand why someone would do it. You just sorta forget about it when doing something else.

And also please always try have it decided whether or not you want to substitute or not if a place doesn't have an item, I've been on the phone with people for a while as well because they don't know what they want.

I let doordash know that it was a packaging issue as I don't think it was necessarily the driver's fault. They gave me roughly a $10 refund (I paid $25 including his tip). 

Its hard to believe he didn't notice because the bag was extremely soggy and tearing on the side you would have to put your hand under to carry the bag. I don't believe he deserves five stars because  even though it might not be his fault the ranch exploded, it was negligence on his end to not address it before delivery.

When ordering, I wish people would take into consideration there's only so much that we can carry. And believe it or not, some places don't have drink carriers for some reason.

Accepted an offer this evening, didn't really pay attention to the details of the order, I knew a drink was included but didn't see how many. Went to go pick up the order and it was 2 bags of food and 4 drinks, and the restaurant had no drink carriers. Like, WTF am I supposed to do? Balance some of the drinks on my head?

Once I saw that I told the store employee that without a drink carrier, I have absolutely no way to carry all of that and that my car doesn't even have enough cup holders for that many drinks and just unassigned myself from it and left.

I waited an hour and there was no one to pick it up, door-dash even sent a notification that said there are no dashers and i could pick up my order instead. I couldn‚Äôt pick up my order (hence why i door-dashed) so I wanted to cancel and get a refund. When I went to cancel my order it said i would only get refunded $8 (and some change) and that didnt work for me, so i called customer service and they cancelled it for me. I asked very explicitly if i would get a full refund to my card (a refund of 23.33) and the man on the line said i would, he repeated the amount i would get refunded and said it would go to my card. 

Fast forward to earlier today, I see i have door-dash credits of $8 (and some change), and i was confused because no one mentioned anything about credits. I wanted to make sure my full refund would go to my card like I was told, and I wanted to see if this credit was just complimentary, so I called again and turns out this credit is part of my refund, and only $15 dollars would be going to my card. So i told customer support that I was told i would get a full refund to my CARD, and i made sure I said my card. The lady told me she was able to transfer my full refund to my card, so I felt pretty good.

1731957991.0,The real explanation behind why non tippers get #%^* service,"I see so many posts complaining about the poor service they got from their DoorDasher, and I *think* I can explain it a little more in depth. 

A platinum level dasher has FIRST priority over high paying deliveries, so the people who are tipping adequately are going to get picked up by a platinum dasher. This means the dasher has paid their dues grinding out 100+ garbage orders already, they‚Äôve learned how to be friendly and time efficient, they probably have a stockpile of straws and sauces from various restaurants in their car in case you ask for more sauce after they already left the restaurant, they either use the cheap free insulated bags that DD provided them- or they have been doing it long enough and actually spent their OWN money on nicer insulated bags, they may even put the seat warmer on in their car to ensure your food stays as hot as humanly possible on the ride to you. Why? Because a platinum dasher wants to keep their platinum level. We get less bs low paying orders, we need to keep above a 4.7 rating and 95% completion rate. These dashers aren‚Äôt going to risk their benefits to screw you over out of pettiness. 

The new dashers are the ones given these no to low paying deliveries, cuz it‚Äôll be given to them first & if they accept it and it goes back into circulation- a platinum dasher absolutely will not accept your order, and it will be pushed back down to another new dasher, or even force the original one that declined it to accept it(happened to me when I was still new, I‚Äôd decline an order and it‚Äôd come back around 3 mins later and literally make me accept it against my will)
These dashers don‚Äôt have rapport with DD yet, they haven‚Äôt done that many dashes yet, they‚Äôre still figuring out the system and the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of dashing, and deciding if they even like doing it or not. This is why if you don‚Äôt tip, a new dasher, or a dasher who doesn‚Äôt qualify for platinum status because of bad reviews or too low of a completion rate(means they prob have stolen some orders or quit in the middle of a dash) will be the one assigned your order, and your chances of getting a less than favorable delivery are wayyy higher than if you tipped and got it picked up by a platinum dasher who is thirsty for 5* reviews and providing quality service.

If a driver is \*really\* fast, I sometimes add a few extra bucks. Easy orders -- a house with no complicated instructions, etc. 

The drivers say that the tip is less option and more of a 'bid' for them to take the work. And I'm actually fine with that. It makes sense. The problem I have is, the tip is not always commensurate with service. Why should I tip more if DoorDash just sends a driver on a second order before mine?

I have had great drivers deliver my food quickly. Tonight, this guy has had my food in the back of his car for 20 minutes. Probably not even his fault. It's ridiculous. Assuming I'm interpreting it correctly, DoorDash needs to stop with this stacked order garbage. It is frustrating that the tip oftentimes has absolutely nothing to do with the type of service you receive.",doordash,2,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gtu887/stacked_orders/,True,,EdsAHacker,,,False

1731894293.0,Why are drivers so bad at finding addresses?,"I was lazy today and ordered DoorDash twice, once for breakfast and another for dinner. This morning my dasher (who has delivered to me 4+ times before) parked across the street from me. I figured she would see me and just walk over but alas she did not. Instead she calls me and proceeds to repeat over and over again that she does not speak English only Spanish. So I then proceeded to wave my arms around like the wacky wavy inflatable arm guy for several minutes until she looked over and saw me. Then she sends her what looked to be 10 year old kid over to bring me my food never actually getting out of the car herself. 

Then for dinner I tried ordering again and again got another dasher who has delivered to me multiple times. He proceeds to park across the street from my building as well about a half block up from where I'm at. Then he calls me to tell me he's there and I explain I'm actually across the street several houses back. I'm also again already waiting out on my front stoop in anticipation of my delivery so I wave at him thinking surely he sees me. He says he does, great he'll be there in a second. Wrong. Apparently he saw people sitting on another stoop in the complete opposite direction and starts heading there while I'm trying to shout at him from across the busy main street. He did not hear me so I had to call him back and explain that he went the wrong way until finally he realizes his mistake and heads over. He even comments as he's walking up to me oh I should have remembered I've delivered to you a bunch in the past. 

So I just wanna throw this out there for any DoorDash drivers reading this. In America many cities will number housing on certain sides of the street with all odd numbers or all even numbers. Please familiarize yourselves with this so when you see a delivery to 1234 Main Street you know which side of the road to deliver on.

1731860076.0,Detailed Delivery Instructions and still delivered to wrong house,"Hey Door dash community,

I placed an order last night and it got sent to my neighbors (who I'm not cordial with and wouldn't trust with my food at all). It isn't the first time this has happened but the first time the dasher told me the location ping was at their address. I checked and it didn't appear to be but I edited it to be sure. 

Ive also seen people suggesting you should include in the delivery notes detailed instructions in case the ping is wrong. Since then I've always left very specific instructions to avoid confusion (ex: please leave on the green chair, we have a no soliciting sign in the window).

Yesterday I ordered and the picture showed the driver left it at my neighbors on the floor outside their door. Someone brought my food back and rang the bell (also in my delivery instructions not to do since we have a loud dog). I'm suspecting it was someone staying at my neighbors (I think they're away) and fortunately the food was still sealed so I don't believe it was tampered with. I'm just frustrated because I'm not sure why I'm tipping a driver beforehand for them to still not follow clearcut instructions.

 I know doordash is cut throat and people don't make a lot of money. I feel bad filing a complaint and maybe getting the delivery driver in trouble. I have no proof they corrected their mistake because the picture shows it at the wrong address - and that is also their proof they correctly delivered, which obviously they didn't. DD hasn't prompted me to rate the delivery which I find odd but I'm not well versed in doordash and it's workings. 

I'm just conflicted because I don't think I should be paying for a wrong delivery when I've done everything to make it clear where I'm located. Just wondering what delivery drivers think about this as you have insight into the other side. Could it be this is just a doordash bug or was the driver just neglectful? I just don't want to be unfair to the delivery driver if this wasn't explicitly their fault.

What a lasting impression they left with their message. Couldn't tell you their name for the life of me but I could tell you their address.

The store had closed by that time, so I checked and the order was completed and he blocked me from communicating with him. He's obviously taken it.

I spoke to Doordash support who said they can't process a refund at all because it's an alcohol order. Then wtf happens to my money?? 

I've spoken to five different agents and all they can tell me is that I can't get my money back and that's it.

1731840783.0,DoorDash Deactivated me. ,"**UPDATE:** I should have clarified this earlier‚Äîmy stats plummeted after I moved to a city I won't name in North Florida from Orlando. In Orlando, I had a 95% acceptance rate, 100% completion rate, 99% on-time rate, and a perfect 5.0 customer rating. I was thriving there. But since moving, my experience has been terrible, and so are my stats.

The traffic here is a nightmare. Every day, I either witness an accident or a close call. This city consistently ranks in the top 15 for worst drivers in the US‚Äîwith a little research, you'll figure out which city I'm in. Food is almost always late, making multi-apping a risky move. Drivers are either painfully slow or dangerously aggressive. In one week alone, I've nearly been hit three times by people blowing through stop signs. GPS here is useless; I'm constantly having to call customers for directions. It‚Äôs one thing for GPS to be off occasionally, but here it regularly drops me in the middle of nowhere.

I've been dinged with low ratings for things beyond my control. A leaky cup holder (I ended up buying my own off Amazon), a duplex with the same unit number and street name as the one two blocks over. Why would you have two identical addresses within a 3-block radius? 

Once I arrived at an address with three identical food orders already sitting outside, making mine #4. After leaving, I get a call from the customer saying she never got the order. After a bit of research, I realize that all the food I saw was from her constantly having to reorder her food because her address doesn't show up correct in the GPS because there's a house with the exact address as her duplex a block away! 

And don't even get me started on trying to deliver to trailer parks in the middle of the night when you can't even see the address/unit on the trailer. It's been a nightmare.

So yeah, judge me all you want. I'll take it. But this low-stat performance is a recent phenomenon. A month ago, I drove back to Orlando and my stats improved in just those two days, so I'm not just imagining things.

Anyway, I'll take the L. DD has been a real pain here, and honestly, I'm over it now. My instacart stats are fantastic, and I'll just have to drive back to orlando to work and get my UberEats stats back up. I'm planning on moving out of this crappy city as soon as I get my finances back in order. 

**ORIGINAL POST:** I worked for DoorDash for over a year, consistently going above and beyond for customers. At the time of my deactivation, my acceptance rate was around 45%, customer rating 4.7, and completion rate was 93% with 2 contract violations‚Äîone which was removed after a dispute.

DoorDash has been a stressful gig. Most zones near me don't pay well. The only zone that does requires scheduling a week in advance, which needs to be done between 12am and 4am, as they fill up fast due to market oversaturation.

The app is glitchy. It often freezes, kicking me out of my scheduled shift. If I pause for a few minutes, it sometimes ends my shift early, and driving out of my zone for 10+ minutes can do the same.

I was deactivated for late deliveries. I‚Äôve stayed late at restaurants to ensure customers get their orders, even when previous drivers failed to deliver. DoorDash staff told me this was okay, but it seems to have impacted my Completed on Time rating, which was around 75%. If there was a threshold for this metric, I would have appreciated knowing, so I could have avoided waiting and declined those orders.

I requested an appeal, but it was denied without explanation. I‚Äôm frustrated because I had shifts lined up this weekend that I now can‚Äôt work.

I used to dismiss complaints about DoorDash on Reddit, thinking people weren't being honest about their performance. Now, I get it. DoorDash demanded more from me than I ever did from them. I worked hard because they paid better than UberEats locally, despite fewer orders. Now, I‚Äôm forced back to UberEats, where the rates are terrible‚Äîlike $3 for 15 miles.

I chose gig work to escape the usual workplace issues. The appeal was the control over hours and earnings, even if the pay wasn't great. Now, right before the holidays when I need money most, I can‚Äôt work. DoorDash turned out worse than any brick-and-mortar job‚Äîthere‚Äôs no HR or warning, just a sudden deactivation that leaves you unemployed.

My advice: take the complaints on Reddit seriously and protect your job. Ultimately, the best job is one you control. I‚Äôm making changes to ensure I‚Äôm never this dependent on a company like DoorDash again.

1731795528.0,I'm so confused about tipping...,"It used to be possible to tip upon placing the order, or upon delivery. Then it was changed to ""you can't tip before delivery"". So I'd just have to tip in the app right after seeing the delivery person or pay in the app after grabbing my food if I opted for contactless non-interaction.

Last year I had an issue where I couldn't tip at all even after delivery, so I did a live-chat and the support person applied the tip for me. They asked, and I sad ""please apply a $5 tip to this order for the dasher"" (in not so many words).

Okay, so you can't tip while waiting for the order or before pick-up and delivery. Fine, it's not really logical to tip until after I receive my food. Last night I place a double-dash order so in this case I definitely want to tip properly. As the man was approaching my door, I try to give a tip in the app and it doesn't work. I get some error message. 

So luckily, just in the nick of time I give the man a $5 bill.... that's something, but it's not enough for shuffling to 7-11 while also delivering my Chinese food. So I try again in the app, I try to tip both orders... both give an error. The next step, reach out to support.

I start a live-chat with a chat-bot which eventually gets me a human keyboard operator. Must be a keyboard operator because all they did was read me the policy about how you can't tip before the dasher pics-up or delivers the food. It's as if they didn't really read my issue. So, I reiterate... and hten the person tells me **""it's too late to tip because you can't tip after the order is completed""**.



I'm so confused. **Can't tip before but can't tip after, either?** I'm sure I'm just missing something obvious, but this is feeling a bit unnecessary complicated for me as someone who just wants to no screw over any person who delivers food to my door. Can anyone please help me understand this before I reach out to support for a third time (which precedes a formal complaint, which sux bc that doesn't get a fair tip to the dasher).",doordash,3,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gsyk1m/im_so_confused_about_tipping/,True,,djronnieg,,,False

As deaf myself, you can't expect me to call you or pick up a call from you. Text is the absolute. I'm so tired of waiting on customers to respond. I need gate code, specific locations and etc, because either you didn't bother to put in instructions or not being clear with directions. Often customers pinned at wrong locations on the map and I can't always count on pinned locations to proper delivery. Also I hate waiting on customers to respond to food or drink options when the store ran out of specifically items. I'm not going to wait for more than 5 minutes on you to waste my time.

1731790381.0,How to consider appropriate/fair tip for Delivery App Drivers.,"This is a guide that just helps people consider a fair tip for their order so you are likely to get quick and efficient delivery.

1. The most important aspect of calculating a tip for Doordash, should mostly be based on distance and time the driver will have to go. So if you are ordering from a Restaurant 5 miles away and it normally takes 10-15 minutes to drive there, the tip should reflect that. Consider the driver needs to wait on the order. A minimum tip in this scenario should be $5(all of this is based on assumption that the delivery is done correctly and all instructions are followed aka a good job).

2. Order size should only be factored into your tip if the order is heavy or larger than normal. A 15+ item shopping order is absolutely something you should be factoring into your tip. Time is $.. ordering 1 tiny thing from CVS should not change anything when it comes to tipping based on time and distance. 

3. Time of day and traffic need to be factored into your tip. If you live in a densely populated area, that is prone to traffic and has parking difficulties, and your order during Rush Hour, please consider the extra time and effort the driver will need to exert for a delivery like this.


These 3 things are the main considerations to take into account if you care about tipping fairly and appropriately. This is not a thread to argue about tipping or exact amounts. It is just a basic guide to help regular people understand how Doordash drivers can be fairly tipped and what to consider when tipping. That is all. I feel like many people do not understand how to tip app drivers, and many customers have asked me about this, so I thought a simple guide could be helpful.

1731739860.0,"Okay, I think I need technical help","I commented on someone else's post earlier today, which ended up becoming a big long back & forth with several other people. In a nutshell, it's sounds like either my app is glitched, or else I am simply not understanding the rating system. So here goes ...

My total number of customer ratings suddenly dive bombed this week. I have approx. 750 lifetime deliveries, and as of last week I had 99 customer ratings. (I don't recall the exact breakdown, but it was like 98 were 5-star and 1 was 4-star. Something like that.) Meaning, my average overall rating was like 4.98 or something. Suddenly, at the start of this current week, my total number of customer ratings is only 10, and my average has gone up to 5.0

After speaking with a few other dashers here on this subreddit, I got the impression that my app might be glitched. So I chatted with 3 different support agents tonight after my dashing was done, but they all told me the exact same thing: 1) If I think my app is glitched, do this list of troubleshooting steps. [Your basic clear cache, uninstall and reinstall the app, etc.] Well I did the entire list of things like 3x and it didn't help. Which brings us to 2) All 3 of the agents I spoke with told me that customer ratings ""roll over"" after each 100 deliveries. I talked around and around and around with all of them, explaining that I wasn't talking about the AVERAGE, what I was talking about is the BREAKDOWN, or the individual total ratings. But they would just repeat the same thing, that it refreshes after every 100 deliveries and the ratings restart at zero.

By the time I was done with the 3rd support agent, I was thoroughly confused. So that's why I'm turning to my fellow dashers... can you please help me understand?

(The screenshots are of just one conversation I had with support, but all my conversations basically went the same way. I'm pretty sure they were talking about AVERAGE rating, and they were not understanding that I was asking about the BREAKDOWN.)

* your acceptance rate matters; they look at it to see how well you are dependable. They may not say it, but they are watching and will give you better deals and orders ""invisible hand"" 
* As a 1099, part time, just do the taxes on turbo tax and take standard deduction. I dont track all that bullshit.
* Use the doordash debit card and keep all expenses on that, for work, lunches/dinners on shift, etc. Even groceries. 
* Work peak hours AMAP, its worth it then. I made like 65-70 in 3 hours last saturday 07:30pm-10pm
* Try to do it part time, 05:30-08:30 is great.
* working class people TIP GOOD they are your street friends. dont expect rich folks to tip.
* Keep a kind demeanour about you even if you are cranky or tired, be non-judgemental and offer resolutions to customers that are speedy and in their favor. 
* More importantly, stay consistent don't just have a shitty night and quit. Keep at it
* Maintain your acceptance rate above 70, don't decline unless you have an emergency, and even take the shit long distance order that's 15 miles for 8 bucks time to time.

1731725403.0,Dashing was an absolute bust this evening,"I don't get what the deal was, dashing Friday evenings typically is when I make a crap load of money. Usually back to back orders, great offers with good tips. I figured with the big boxing match this evening that even more people would be ordering so they could stay home and watch the match. Far from the case.

Typically any night of the week I make $70-$150, started dashing at 3PM and stopped about 8:30 and I never even made it to $30 that entire time. Offers were far and few between, a crap ton of no-tip offers. Got a crap ton of lowball offers for like $6 wanting me to deliver 8+ miles away. My AR tanked big time this evening. I typically keep it 85%-90% to maintain platinum status so I can decline crap offers. Ended the night with my AR at 73%. 

I got so many $2 no-tip and $3 offers it was f'king ridiculous. I've never declined so many offers in one night, most evenings the offers are great and don't have to decline any. I don't get what the deal was this evening. I generally don't touch $4 offers, but that's all doordash was throwing me and I wanted to make some $$$ so I just started accepting them as long as they were going less than a mile. Sadly, 5 hours dashing the best offer I got this evening paid $5.50. This was NOT a normal evening of dashing for me.

1731712192.0,Double charged ,"TLDR- Doordash had double charged me $300 and denied ever doing so. 

I posted this last week to this sub but I was stressed out about this whole situation to make any ounce of sense.

On Halloween, I had ordered about $300 worth of groceries. I did this because I have a significant back injury and no car. While the driver was shopping, something wasn't available so the price changed/went down. I was like sweet, thanks for the heads up and the dasher had changed it from the app and at the end of the whole order, the amount was corrected to the right amount it was supposed to. 
The next day, I looked at my bank account and saw the adjustment price was already posted on my account. The Saturday morning afterwards, I looked at my bank account and saw that there was a pending charge on my account for another $300. So I called Doordash to see why I was charged again, and when I called, they explained that it was the adjusted price, i told them it wasn't, that it was already posted and that this was a completely different charge. 
When I sent them a screenshot of my bank statement and then I was then told ""No, we didn't charge you that"" even though the new pending charge was the exact same amount and says the exact same thing. When I pointed it out to them and that if they could do anything about it, I was screamed at to ""Fuck you and your payment, it's not our job to figure that fucking shit out."" I had that said to me twice by two separate people trying to figure out why I was charged.

my questions are: does dashpass mitigate the lack of tip in any way? would you accept for ex. a biggie bag order with $2 tip if the wendy‚Äôs is 1.2 miles away? lastly should i order DD less frequently as to not burden dashers with my bad orders?

The full order comes in to the kitchen no problem, but on the tablet, it only shows the customer ordered a side of sauce. It is SIMILAR to the other side of sauce scam they‚Äôve been doing but it‚Äôs different in this sense-

The kitchen received a full order of food with a specific customers name from DoorDash. Multiple entrees. Kitchen starts to prepare as normal. 

As orders are set to automatically send to the kitchen because we get a pretty good to-go business throughout the day, upon reviewing the order, it‚Äôs just a side of cheese sauce  which is $1. 

Here‚Äôs my hypothesis:
The customer makes their order as normal, and has a pre-loaded script to run, that deletes the full cart, adds a side of cheese sauce to the cart, while the 1-2 second payment processing window is happening. So the ‚Äúsend to kitchen‚Äù function is happening before payment is confirmed somehow. 

We‚Äôve been hit for quite a pretty penny on this. Not gonna share numbers but it was hefty.

Yesterday I picked up from the local Chinese place and realized it was not only the first time that I've had a delivery from there but also I didn't realize they delivered. I love their food and always had to go through their website to do a pick up order and it's kind of a hassle because parking downtown can be a pain.

I asked the guy ""hey how long have y'all been on Doordash?"" but he didn't speak very good English so I didn't really get an answer.

Later that night I wanted to see if they were indeed now accepting Doordash orders and the restaurant isn't listed at all.

How did this customer get his food delivered?! There is no option for delivery on their website, either. Just pick up",doordash,13,1,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1grxz4z/doordash_from_a_restaurant_not_on_doordash/,True,,AlternativeAble3929,,,False
1731681943.0,Dashers keep leaving my order at the wrong address.,"I live in a duplex, and it's not that hard to just walk to the other door. We have it in clear, concise wording where our door is, and every single time we've gotten something delivered they drop it off at the door.
Is it rude to start with no tip going forward? We can always increase after, but I don't see the point in tipping if they're just going to ignore delivery instructions.
Sorry, just a rant. It's super frustrating, especially when we're sick and can barely even get to the door, let alone have the energy to put shoes on and go to the other door to get it.
Edit: I realize I may sound like a Karen. I just don't understand. Our pin is at our door, not the other one. I'm an Instacart shopper, and I make sure that I deliver to the right door no matter what. It just gets annoying that nobody seems to care enough to leave our food at the correct door, despite the pin and the delivery notes.

1731608757.0,Door Dash is so bad‚Ä¶ it might be good. ,"Advice on how to make sure as a customer, your orders are correct?

I door dash daily because I was signed up for the annual dash pass without my permission, and when I tried to cancel it within 10 minutes of noticing the subscription charge, they refused. So, I decided to use it as much as possible in the year to get my moneys worth. 

I am not joking when I say for every 10 orders I do, maybe 2 or 3 are correct. Only 1 or 2 of 10 ever come as a complete order with utensils and everything. 

It is my go to now to send a message that says ‚ÄúHi (dasher,) please double check for (drink/side/food/etc) and utensils as (restaurant) usually forgets. Thank you so much!‚Äù As a way to cover my bases as the customer. 

They usually always respond with ‚Äúwill do‚Äù but my orders still arrive wrong. I always report it for the difference back, and since I‚Äôm a frequent user they often throw on an apology credit with the refund. So i realistically get a lot of things for free because door dash hires incompetent people. 

My question is: what else can I possibly do to ensure my orders are right? I feel bad that the company has to refund me every other day, but I‚Äôm also not paying for items I didn‚Äôt receive‚Ä¶ like paying for a large $7 soda and getting an empty cup and no straw.

What else can I do? Or does DD just suck?",doordash,51,0,0.27,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1grbisr/door_dash_is_so_bad_it_might_be_good/,True,,Remote-Republic1841,,,False

1731603011.0,Spending on service,"I‚Äôm a dasher and a doordash customer often, So I understand both sides of wanting tips and not wanting to spend a lot on delivery by giving a low tip. But the thing is, you pay for your food and the service if you want it delivered. Doordash also is a corporation so they‚Äôre going to obviously take their cut whether or not you agree it should be lower so they can pay drivers more. I understand the regular definition of a tip as being an extra if you receive especially good service, so on doordash I think using the word tip when in actuality you‚Äôre paying to receive the service in the first place instead of giving extra for good service, is a misnomer because it leads some customers to believe that it‚Äôs an extra payment for good service when in reality it‚Äôs going to be the majority of what a dasher makes and should be based on how badly you need something delivered and how much you think a dasher deserves for completing a service for you. I agree that it should be doordash paying us but the fact is that they aren‚Äôt. That isn‚Äôt going to change any time soon so while it is unfair, the responsibility of paying the people in your community falls on you, the consumer.

Your smoke permeates your orders. It makes them smell and taste foul. Stop being gross and smoking your cancer sticks in the car with your customers' food. They can and will complain and you can and will either be dinged for it or be locked out as a Dasher. Customers have respiratory issues. Customers have allergies. Customers have asthma. And if a customer tells you ""next time, consider your customer and don't smoke with their order in the car"", don't snap back with ""then go and get it yourself, I'm grown, b\*\*\*\*"".

Not everyone engages in your vice and it causes active harm to some people. Stop it.

Sincerely,

A Dasher & DoorDash customer who ISN'T nasty.

My question is though, why aren‚Äôt we, unhappy customers and dashers as a whole kinda doing anything about their absolutely horrible downturn in business practices? Like tanking their ratings on all possible platforms, App Store, BBB, wherever is possible to leave DoorDash a rating? 
I know it feels like nudging their 4.8 star rating on Apple App Store from over a million reviews seems pointless, but like‚Ä¶ if enough folks do something, and explain why they‚Äôre so unhappy‚Ä¶ maybe something will give?

I dunno, I just am so dejected that a service I was once really happy with has gone in the toilet.

I edit that and put the same instructions in for where to leave the order.

I have a sick husband freshly home from the hospital and two large dogs (who rightfully scare the crap out of people) who aren't fans of people coming to the door. I just want a simple, hassle free delivery to feed me and the kid.

The driver comes up to the door (I am watching on the camera with the dogs in another room hoping to avoid a fuss) and he bangs on the door. About two seconds later he is ringing the bell, then bangs again, and rings the bell TWO MORE TIMES.

I open the door a crack - the dogs are losing their minds - and say ""please leave the food on the chair, per the instructions."" And close the door. And go back to watching the camera. He looks confused, then a bit pissed, and turns and looks as though he's going to walk away with the food. Then he yells at the car ""get my phone"" before putting the food on the chair, giving up on whoever he was yelling to, and leaves.

Where is the disconnect? I don't know if I should be upset with the dasher for not following instructions or upset with Wendy's for not relaying information, or with Door Dash for not relaying information. But I can say it has happened twice now when ordering through the Wendy's app.

To a lesser degree, I have always wondered why it was such a big deal on their end whether the order is left at the door or handed off. If handed off they don't get any kind of proof. They know they handed it off but they don't take a picture of the customer or get a code or anything that would prove they handed it off. So if something goes south it's kind of a he said/she said situation. But if it's left per the customer's instruction they have to take a photo.",doordash,3,1,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gq7b29/disconnect_when_ordering_from_restaurant_and/,True,,FrankieMaddox,,,False

1731393297.0,Possible Scam: Customer's Perspective,"Wanted to share in case this helps anyone/ wondering if anyone had a similar experience.

I order a bag of dog food through Petco, which uses doordash drivers.

Right as the order was supposed to be delivered, I had two calls come one from a man followed by a woman within minutes of each other asking if my order had been delivered. They both hung up quickly after I told them no, but the map shows it should be soon. The woman claimed that the driver said it had been delivered. I don't recall giving them any personal information, but may have confirmed my phone number? I don't recall.

Shortly after I got a text from petco saying my order was delivered and to call my dasher ""Robert"" if there was any issues. I had not recieved the item, and when I called the number it was an old lady who did not know who Robert was.

I called doordash support, they said that they had not called me. They said they had a different number on file than the one petco's doordash number provided me ( I know this is petco's number as they provided me with the doordash tracking and I've gotten order texts from them before). They did not recieve a picture from the driver. They dispatched a new dasher.

The new dasher called me from Petco saying that Petco gave my dog food to the first dasher an hour prior and that I need to call Petco support to dispatch a new order, so the new dasher could not even pick up my order despite already being there, so they had to cancel my order. I felt bad for the dasher who drove there with no order to pick up, but she was very understanding about it.

Given the discrepency in the phone number for the initial dasher, I'm pretty sure the dasher just stole it. But maybe someone scammed the initial dasher and changed the numbers? Why would ""doordash"" call me to ask if the order was delivered?

1731390592.0,FT KNOX DOORDASHING,"Hey everyone. I did doordash awhile back in London, KY. I recently relocated to Elizabethtown, KY. I started doordash again over the weekend and only got 38 orders toward my 100 to get platinum perks from Friday to today (Monday). There must be a ton of dashers in Etown because it hardly let's me dash now during lunch and dinner rushes, and when it does, it's only for 30 minute increments then cuts me off. Even scheduling doesn't have Etown hardly until like 4-5 days later with awful times for example of 2-330 am. I have a full-time job Tuesday-Friday from 7am-5:30pm, so I'm just dashing after work and of course Saturday-Monday when I can.

The reason I started dashing again is because the paychecks from my regular 40 hr job are literally gone every week. It takes every penny I have to afford my bills. I've made a lot of dumb choices with loans and credit cards, and when adding rent, car payment, insurance, utilities, etc I am 100% broke on Fridays. When I say I don't have a penny left from those checks, I mean it. While I'm not too upset about being broke because all my bills are paid which is most important for me, it's really hard to do anything else. I can't even afford a McDouble if I wanted it and occasionally it does get frustrating and mentally exhausting.

That being said, I relocated here to start a life with  my girlfriend who I had a long distance relationship with. She's literally the best thing that has ever happened to me and I know people say this all the time, but this woman truly, TRULY!!, saved my life. She got me away from all the bad stuff I was doing and still loves me solely for me and nothing else. She loved the good and the bad and doesn't judge me in the slightest for my past. She's the biggest blessing aside from my daughter that I've ever received in my life, and I'm extremely grateful to have her and try my best to make sure she knows everyday she's alive how beautiful, amazing, and loved she is by me.

All that sappy stuff aside lol, I am doordashing to save up to buy her an engagement ring. The one I want is $1500. I made $254 last weekend, and I'm trying my hardest to make the money by Christmas. I am willing to work my ass off to achieve that, honestly. I just want to make her happy is all.

I was hoping someone in here is from the Etown area and could tell me what dashing on Ft. Knox is like and if it's worth it. They are always showing as either very busy to busy the entire day. It even let's you schedule the entire day the next day from 7am-9pm instead of 4-5 days later like Etown does. I'm pretty sure they're open to dashing from 7am-9pm everyday, but I may be wrong. I know you have to go to the visitors center to get a 1 year pass, I do know that.

My main question is, do they order a lot from places on base, or is it mostly off base then back on? I really don't want to have to go to Etown and back over and over 100x a day. Radcliff wouldn't be so bad, or on base even better. My brother works for the DoD and has to go in office 2 days a week on base and he said the MPs are really strict about speeding as well so much so that he said they've pulled people over and immediately searched their car. Are they really that strict? I just don't see it being worthwhile to drive to say Dunkin in Etown from base then back for $5.50 and also always looking over my shoulder to get pulled over doing 37 in a 35. If anyone has any experience there, please let me know so if it's worth it, I can be down Saturday to get my pass and hopefully make some good money to get closer to getting this ring.

Thanks so much guys. Yall are awesome",doordash,1,0,0.33,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1gpdzhr/ft_knox_doordashing/,True,,Kb161988,,,False

1731318265.0,DASH HACKS,"I just wanted to offer up a few tips and tricks I've picked up over nearly 1k dashes. I've made some damn good money when I had to. Dash during prime time! Lunch and dinner; there's usually a good 4-4.5hr window for both depending on your market. Try to hang around areas with alot of dining options, from fast food to sometimes fine dining. Try to avoid areas that you know don't, or probably won't tip. Every city has bad areas. Don't be afraid to decline the BS  Try to accept orders that average  $1.50+/mile; that's really the only way to start making decent money but it's honestly not always possible to do that. Now if a $20 15 mile order comes in, I'm prolly taking that, and if it's a slow time of day, I'll take some BS just to pass the time it keep my rates up. If you have to pause your dash for a short bit to get back to a good zone, then do it. Look at the customer instructions and map before you leave. GPS isn't always right and if you know the area, short cuts can save you so much time. Especially during rush hour or in high traffic areas. TIME IS MONEY! Communicate with the customer via text from wait time to eta with the order. I get so many added tips and cash tips just because I communicate, and sometimes BS with the customer. Most importantly, please take your appearance, and your vehicle's if possible, seriously. Nobody wants someone who looks like they smell funny handling their food lol. Be friendly and smile with your entire face; body language speaks volumes. Just remember that ultimately, we're in the customer service business. It feels like I've been rambling, but it's because stuff just kept coming to me and I'm sure there's more. There's definitely money to be made if you really want to make it. I hope this helps.

1731314603.0,NOT THE SAME FOR EVERYONE! ,"Everybody has to remember that each market is different. Also, you have to know where, and when to dash; most importantly, you just have to go get it. You have to know when to pause your dash to get away from a shitty zone, and when to decline an offer that may look ok at first glance. It's really just simple math with money, mileage, and time and it's quick to calculate. There are so many little tricks to this shit. I'm in a relatively small market in NW Louisiana; I've just learned LOTS of little hacks. I don't usually do this full time, but I had the time over last couple weeks and wanted to show myself and others what could be done if it really has to be.

I feel so bad and not sure what I shoulda donee different. I should have immediately put the food back outside but obviously I didn‚Äôt and i feel dumb for not doing that.

1731281196.0,Terrible dasher experience ,"Just got my order a few mins ago, and the dasher had over 15,000 deliveries with a 4.8 rating. And the result is a pizza that looked like it wasn't taken care of at all during the delivery process. I don't know how it's possible to have that many deliveries as a dasher and not know pizza needs to be handled horizontally when delivering? I had to rewind security camera footage to see what happened and this dasher on his bike handled the pizza like it was a book. Also, when he took it out his book bag vertically, he proceeded to shake the pizza box as if it that was going to help. SMH. I did get my money back after sending photos to customer service, but this shouldn't really be happening.

Update: I've added camera footage of this great dasher, to back up my claims. I'm saddened that there are people who actually defend this type of service as being acceptable.

1731281057.0,Question for Dashers in New York City‚Äî do you see the order ahead of time? ,"So I regularly use DoorDash for large grocery orders. I don‚Äôt have a car and I have physical limitations so this has been a great option. I always tip despite the fact that there is apparently an hourly rate and always tip pretty well. Just getting that out of the way. I placed an order from a grocery store that had a fair amount of items, nothing too crazy‚Ä¶ I see the Dasher that accepts the order is on a bike apparently. Assuming that the little icon thing that DoorDash shows is accurate. It takes this person quite a long time to reach the grocery store and by the time they do, they call me angrily saying that I ordered too much for DoorDash. The person had very broken English, but I kept telling them to cancel the order and they never did but acted as if the majority of items were out of stock‚Ä¶ they were definitely not the kind of items that would be out of stock. My order total was about $100 and they delivered maybe a third of it. I had already tipped and I was pissed off about this. Customer service was essentially useless, but after badgering them a few times they gave me DoorDash credits to make up for the balance. What happened here? Doesn‚Äôt the Dasher see what the order is? And if they can accept it? Like I would assume that some people avoid orders from certain stores because it‚Äôs too out-of-the-way or they don‚Äôt want to go there or whatever. Why would this person do this?
